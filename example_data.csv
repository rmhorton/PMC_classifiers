37327781,0,Title,Multi-omic longitudinal study reveals immune correlates of clinical course among hospitalized COVID-19 patients
37327781,1,Abstract,"The IMPACC cohort, composed of >1,000 hospitalized COVID-19 participants, contains five illness trajectory groups (TGs) during acute infection (first 28 days), ranging from milder (TG1–3) to more severe disease course (TG4) and death (TG5). Here, we report deep immunophenotyping, profiling of >15,000 longitudinal blood and nasal samples from 540 participants of the IMPACC cohort, using 14 distinct assays. These unbiased analyses identify cellular and molecular signatures present within 72 h of hospital admission that distinguish moderate from severe and fatal COVID-19 disease. Importantly, cellular and molecular states also distinguish participants with more severe disease that recover or stabilize within 28 days from those that progress to fatal outcomes (TG4 vs. TG5). Furthermore, our longitudinal design reveals that these biologic states display distinct temporal patterns associated with clinical outcomes. Characterizing host immune responses in relation to heterogeneity in disease course may inform clinical prognosis and opportunities for intervention."
37327781,2,Introduction,"Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, scientists worldwide have characterized immune responses and host-pathogen interactions to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection to gain insight into disease pathogenesis and identify potential interventions for COVID-19. Studies assessing distinct elements of viral variants and cellular and humoral immunity from different participant populations have greatly improved our understanding of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis.1,2,3,4,5,6 However, to design and deploy precision prognostics and therapeutics, it is essential to address the heterogeneity in clinical outcomes of COVID-19 and precisely define correlates of host immune responses to that heterogeneity."
37327781,3,Introduction,"The clinical manifestations of COVID-19 are diverse, ranging from asymptomatic disease to hospitalization and death.7,8,9 Even among hospitalized patients, who are at the highest risk for death, clinical courses are highly variable. To provide a comprehensive and unbiased study of the clinical course, immunology, virology, and genetics of acute COVID-19, we established a geographically diverse US consortium of 15 centers and 20 hospital recruitment sites (Immunophenotyping Assessment in a COVID-19 Cohort, or IMPACC).10 IMPACC analyzed participant characteristics to capture the dynamics of clinical course and defined five disease course trajectories spanning rapid recovery through fatal outcomes.11"
37327781,4,Introduction,"Here, we carried out deep immunophenotyping of 15,193 longitudinal samples from 540 IMPACC adult participants with a confirmed positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR over the first 28 days after hospital admission. To define the immune status of the study participants, we employed six core immunophenotyping approaches on blood samples: serology (anti-SARS-CoV-2-specific and anti-interferon [IFN] antibodies), proteomics (circulating markers from serum and plasma reflecting immune status from protein states), metabolomics (metabolites and lipids), CyTOF (leukocyte frequency and phenotype), gene expression (host bulk RNA sequencing [RNA-seq] and metagenomics), and genomics (DNA sequence, genome-wide association study [GWAS]). In addition, we analyzed the nasal epithelium, the port of entry of SARS-CoV-2 infection, for viral load and viral sequences and host transcriptomic profiles. Overall, we identified biologic states associated with the five COVID-19 disease trajectory groups defined by IMPACC, revealing potential determinants of clinical heterogeneity and potential actionable targets for prognostic biomarkers and therapeutic intervention."
37327781,5,Results || Immunophenotyping of participants within five clinical trajectory groups,"We carried out deep immunophenotyping on longitudinal data and samples over the initial 28 days post-hospital admission of 540 adult participants with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection enrolled in the IMPACC cohort between May 6, 2020 and December 9, 2020 (Table S1). Five illness trajectory groups were identified previously11 using clinical data from the entire IMPACC cohort (1,164 participants) and latent class modeling of longitudinal observation of a modified ordinal score,12 reflecting both the degree of respiratory support required and the presence or absence of activity limitations or oxygen requirement at discharge.11 The model classified each participant into one of five groups: trajectory group 1 (TG1; n = 119) was characterized by relatively mild respiratory disease and a brief hospital stay (median [interquartile range (IQR)] 3 [2] days) with no limitations at hospital discharge; TG2 (n = 149) generally required more respiratory support than TG1 and had a longer length of hospital stay (LOS) (median [IQR] 7 [4] days) but no limitations at discharge; and TG3 (n = 110) was characterized by roughly similar respiratory support requirements and LOS (median [IQR] 7 [7] days) as TG2 but generally had limitations at discharge. Two additional groups had overall higher respiratory support requirements during their hospital stay: TG4 (n = 106) generally received more aggressive respiratory support and experienced a prolonged LOS (median [IQR] 20 [12] days), and TG5 (n = 56) was characterized by high respiratory support requirements and fatal illness by day 28 (Figure 1A). Detailed clinical characteristics for the entire IMPACC cohort based on TG assignment have been previously reported.11 Participant demographics, comorbidities, time from symptom onset to hospitalization, and baseline clinical respiratory status, radiographic findings, and clinical laboratory data for the 540 participants with deep immunophenotyping data analyzed here reflect characteristics of the entire IMPACC cohort (Table S1).Figure 1Overview of IMPACC cohort, sample collection, and immunophenotyping(A) Clinical trajectory group assignment of IMPACC cohort participants (N = 1,164).10,11,12(B) The total number of collected tissues (whole blood, serum, plasma, and nasal swab samples) for all acute visits (up to day 28 post-admission, including escalation visits). A total of 15,193 samples were profiled from 540 participants across 20 hospital recruitment sites from 15 biomedical centers.(C) The total number of participants profiled by 14 different immunophenotyping assays over the course of the scheduled acute visits (visits 1–6).(D) Data analysis involved a rigorous data quality and confounder analysis, dimensionality reduction to combine features into modules, and association of module levels at visit 1 and their longitudinal pattern with the clinical trajectory group. Expression levels of modules at visit 1 are depicted as boxplots, while longitudinal patterns are shown as line graphs."
37327781,6,Results || Immunophenotyping of participants within five clinical trajectory groups,"Clinical laboratory values were collected both at baseline and at scheduled visits during the hospital stay if ordered by the clinical care team.10 Longitudinal multi-omics profiles were generated for each participant employing 14 distinct assays on blood and nasal swab samples at each visit. In total, 15,193 biological samples were processed and analyzed from 540 participants (Figure 1B; Table S1). These assays included nasal viral load and sequence, serology, blood cytometry, plasma proteomics, serum cytokine/chemokine, plasma metabolomics, nasal and peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) transcriptomics, nasal metagenomics, and genetics (Figure 1C)."
37327781,7,Results || A common analytic framework to identify associations with clinical severity,"We developed a common analytic framework for all assays (Figure 1D; STAR Methods). Briefly, this framework included a dimensionality reduction step followed by mixed-effects modeling for association with the five clinical trajectory groups, with confounding effects properly adjusted in this process. For assay readouts with >50 features, we identified correlated feature modules (referred to here as “modules”) using weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA).13 For a given module in an assay, we define the module values across samples as the first principal component constructed using features included in this module. We investigated the behavior of each feature (or module) both at visit 1 (within 72 h of hospital admission) and longitudinally (up to 28 days post-hospital admission) and correlated it with clinical outcomes. More specifically, we tested both if a feature exhibited a monotonic trend from the mildest (TG1) to most severe (TG5) disease course at visit 1 using mixed-effect ordinal regression (clmm) and if a feature showed differential kinetics over the whole time course (visits 1–6) via a generalized additive model with mixed effects (gamm4) where we examined if the average (referred to as intercept in the gamm4 documentation) or shape (referred to as the smoothing term in the gamm4 documentation) differs across the clinical trajectory groups. Features with a false discovery rate (FDR) <5% were considered significant based on the adjusted p value (referred to as adj.p).14 For both analyses, significant features were further tested for differences between each pair of TGs to facilitate interpretation.15,16"
37327781,8,Results || Viral loads and antibody responses associated with disease trajectory,"Viral loads and antibody responses are key aspects of host-pathogen interactions that relate to disease severity.17,18,19 We assessed nasopharyngeal viral loads by RT-PCR, viral variants by whole-genome sequencing, anti-receptor binding domain (RBD) and anti-spike immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies by ELISA, and antibodies targeting the entire SARS-CoV-2 linear peptidome by programmable phage display.20"
37327781,9,Results || Viral loads and antibody responses associated with disease trajectory,"Whole-genome viral amplification generated complete viral genomes from 316 nasopharyngeal swab samples collected from 221 participants. Genotyping identified 60 lineages from Phylogenetic Assignment of Named Global Outbreak21,22 (PANGO) across the cohort (Figure 2A). All viral genomes were of the Wuhan strain. No variants of interest or concern, such as Delta or Omicron variants, were detected as the samples were collected prior to the occurrence of these variants. Clinical trajectory group was not associated with any of the 9 lineages that were detected across at least 3 recruitment sites or with participant-specific mutations (Figure 2B).Figure 2SARS-CoV-2 viral loads and antibody responses were associated with clinical trajectory group(A) Viral sequencing identified 60 PANGO lineages across the cohort.(B) The clinical trajectory group was not associated with any of the 9 lineages detected.(C) Viral loads (SARS-CoV-2 N1 gene Ct values) measured from samples collected at visit 1 (significantly higher in participants with more severe disease [adj.p = 0.037]).

(C and E) Shown are median values (horizontal lines), IQRs (boxes), and 1.5 IQRs (whiskers), as well as all individual points."
37327781,10,Results || Viral loads and antibody responses associated with disease trajectory,"SARS-CoV-2 viral loads were measured on 1,174 nasopharyngeal swab samples collected from 474 participants. We did not detect associations between viral load and sex, age, enrollment site, and other sample metadata and demographic variables. However, the RT-PCR median cycle threshold (Ct) values for both SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein genes N1 and N2 differed significantly among the five clinical trajectory groups at hospital admission (visit 1) (N1 Ct, adj.p = 0.04, and N2 Ct, adj.p = 0.04; Figures 2C and S1A). The median viral loads were lowest (higher Ct values) in the participant group with mildest disease (TG1) and highest in the group with most severe disease (TG5). Longitudinal analysis identified additional significant differences in the shape of the viral loads across time (N1 Ct, adj.p = 0.001, and N2 Ct, adj.p = 0.0003, Figures 2D and S1B). While a decline in viral loads was observed for all of the trajectory groups, viral loads in participants with the most severe disease (TG5) plateaued after the first week of hospitalization at a Ct value still <30, suggesting persistent viral RNA throughout the 28 days (Figure 2D)."
37327781,11,Results || Viral loads and antibody responses associated with disease trajectory,"Antibody titers against SARS-CoV-2 RBD IgG and spike IgG were measured in 1,335 serum samples collected from 489 participants. Anti-RBD and anti-spike IgG values at visit 1 were quantitatively lowest in participants with the most severe disease (TG5), but no significant difference was detected among the five clinical trajectory groups (anti-RBD IgG, adj.p = 0.68, and anti-spike IgG, adj.p = 0.68; Figures 2E and S1C). In contrast, the average (anti-spike IgG, adj.p = 0.07) and shape (anti-spike IgG, adj.p = 0.01, and anti-RBD IgG, adj.p = 0.07; Figures 2F and S1D) of the longitudinal responses were different across the trajectory groups, with TG4 showing the highest values of anti-spike and anti-RBD IgG."
37327781,12,Results || Viral loads and antibody responses associated with disease trajectory,"Proteome-wide, linear peptide SARS-CoV-2 (and other human coronaviruses [CoVs]) antibody profiling with VirScan23 (i.e., serum phage immunoprecipitation sequencing [PhIP-seq]) was performed on 1,312 serum samples from 496 participants. No batch effects were observed using principal-component analysis (PCA) (Figure S2A) and principal variance component analysis (PVCA) (Figure S2B). Visit 1 pan-SARS-CoV-2 antibody profiles (Figure S2C) did not show any significant association between clinical trajectory group and seroreactivity to any viral protein or region. Focusing on seroreactivity to the spike (S) protein and nucleoprotein (N), the longitudinal analysis identified 323 significant 20 amino acid (aa) windows that were significantly associated with clinical trajectory groups and that mapped to 8 antigenic regions (Figures 2G and S2D; Table S2). In addition, baseline cross-reactivity to human seasonal CoVs did not correlate with the trajectory group (Figure S2E). Most notably, more severe disease (TG5) was associated with increased seroreactivity to the N-terminal domain (NTD) of S and decreased antibody seroreactivity to the LINK domain of N (adj.p = 0.023) (Figure S2D)."
37327781,13,Results || Viral loads and antibody responses associated with disease trajectory,"Serum samples from 489 participants were screened for autoantibodies against type I IFNs (α, β, and ω) that may enhance susceptibility to severe SARS-CoV-2 infection.2 A higher percentage of individuals with more severe disease (TG4, 9.6%, and TG5, 7.8%) had functional blocking anti-IFN antibodies than seen in mild disease (<5% for each of TG1–3; Table S3; p = 0.001). Overall, these data show that viral loads along with anti-SARS-CoV-2 and anti-IFN antibody levels (all lowest in TG1) are significantly associated with clinical disease trajectory, suggesting an important role for antibodies in the host responses and clinical outcomes."
37327781,14,Results || Analysis of serum and plasma proteomics identifies modules related to natural killer (NK) cells and coagulation pathways associated with severe disease,"Soluble proteins are key effectors of immunity in blood. Cytokines, chemokines, and secreted receptors mediate a fast response and short-lived signaling, leading to slower but also longer-lasting changes in plasma protein abundances. Two complementary methodologies were used to investigate the link between protein markers and the clinical trajectory groups. A Proximity Extension Assay (PEA)-based technology (Olink) was used to quantify 92 inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and soluble receptors in serum; liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS) was used to monitor 241 selected classical plasma proteins in a targeted fashion and 508 plasma proteins that were detected and quantified in discovery mode. The rationale for this 3-pronged approach was to increase the coverage of the serum/plasma proteome by using dedicated workflows for chemokines, cytokines, and secreted receptors and two different fractions of the plasma proteome before and after depletion of the most abundant plasma proteins.24"
37327781,15,"Results || Olink-link based cytokine, chemokine, and secreted receptor analysis","Olink was generated and analyzed on 1,386 serum samples from 517 participants. The Olink assay detects and quantifies cytokines, chemokines, and secreted receptors (for brevity, all referred to as “soluble proteins”). No batch effect was observed using PCA (Figure S3A) and PVCA (Figure S3B). WGCNA identified six modules ranging from 6 to 30 soluble proteins (Figure S3C; Table S4). The ImmuneXpresso25 database, associating cytokines, chemokines, and secreted receptors to their action on immune cells, was used to label the six Olink modules. At visit 1, five of these modules were significantly associated with clinical outcome (Table S4)."
37327781,16,"Results || Olink-link based cytokine, chemokine, and secreted receptor analysis","One of these five modules (Olink.mod3, annotated as “activators of NKs”) was higher in participants who recovered relatively quickly (TG1–3) (adj.p = 8.85e−11). This module, composed of 11 soluble proteins, was enriched for features related to activating cytotoxic NK cells and included molecules such as CD244 and interleukin 12B (IL-12B) (Figure 3A). Six out of the 11 proteins were annotated to “activator of lymphocytes” based on ImmuneXpresso25 and a literature search.26,27,28,29 This module had an increased expression in milder trajectory groups, suggesting a role in disease recovery (Figure 3B). Consistent with this hypothesis, the expression of this module increased across time in groups TG1 through TG4, but not in the fatal trajectory group (TG5), where the opposite trend was observed (shape: adj.p = 4.44e−12, average: adj.p = 3.39e−18; Figure 3C). Notably, participants in TG4 that presented with severe disease but survived past day 28 started with lower levels of “activators of NKs” but exhibited an increase of those markers over time to levels comparable to TG1–3. In contrast, four modules (Olink.mod1 [adj.p = 4.01e−6] annotated as “cytokines produced by neutrophils” including the cytokine tumor necrosis factor [TNF] and IL-17A; Olink.mod2 [adj.p = 3.55e−18] annotated as “pro-inflammatory”; Olink.mod4 [adj.p = 4.08e−4] including the ADA deaminase; and Olink.mod6 [adj.p = 2.38e−5] annotated as “activators of macrophages”) were higher at visit 1 in participants with a more severe disease course (Table S4). The most significant module, Olink.mod2, was composed of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, including IL-6, CXCL-8 (IL-8), and CXCL-10 (IP10) (Figure 3D) (13/17 proteins) annotated as “produced by monocytes.”30,31,32 Baseline (Figure 3E) and longitudinal analyses revealed that this pro-inflammatory module persisted at elevated levels in participants that ultimately died (TG5), while it decreased over time in participants in the other trajectory groups (TG1–4) (shape adj.p = 4.70e−10, average adj.p = 4.40e−42; Figure 3F). In addition, cytokines in the pro-inflammatory modules were directly induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection (Figure S3D). Overall, these results identified early cytokines and chemokines as well as an NK cell link that are associated with clinical trajectories that distinguish fatal from non-fatal disease.Figure 3Association of serum proximity extension assay (Olink) and plasma proteomics modules with clinical trajectory groups(A–F) Analysis of serum Olink data identified significant associations in the expression levels of (A–C) Olink.mod3 and (D–F) Olink.mod2 among clinical trajectory groups.

37327781,17,Results || Targeted mass spectrometry-based classical plasma proteomics analysis,"In total, 1,302 plasma samples from 500 participants were subjected to a targeted LC/MS-based proteomics assay. Using the multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) data acquisition mode, we tracked 241 classical plasma proteins, many of which have immune modulatory roles and thus are important for a more complete molecular immunophenotyping. PVCA (Figure S4A) and PCA (Figures S4B and S4C) indicated batch effects based on the two phases in which the samples were processed and analyzed, which were corrected for using the ComBat algorithm.33 For this targeted dataset of classical plasma proteins, WGCNA resulted in 7 modules ranging in size from 16 to 62 proteins. Two of the seven modules (Targeted.Prot.mod1 and Targeted.Prot.mod3) showed significant differences across the five clinical trajectory groups (Figure S4D)."
37327781,18,Results || Targeted mass spectrometry-based classical plasma proteomics analysis,"Targeted.Prot.mod1 was enriched for proteins annotated to the “coagulation” pathway (14/62 proteins), including the fibrinolysis stimulator plasma kallikrein (KLKB1) (Figure 3G). Its expression differed significantly between TGs at visit 1 (adj.p = 2.19e−3; Figure 3H) and longitudinally (shape adj.p = 3.06e−14, average adj.p = 1.61e−14; Figure 3I). Participants in the mild to moderate clinical trajectory groups (TG1–3) started out with increased levels of Targeted.Prot.mod1 relative to participants from the more severe trajectory groups (TG4–5). In addition to starting at higher levels (Figure 3H), participants in TG1–3 showed a steady increase in their abundance levels over time (Figure 3I). In contrast, participants in TG4–5 showed a clear downward pattern during their hospital stays, highlighting the prognostic nature associated with the dynamics and directionality of the proteins in Targeted.Prot.mod1. Interestingly, participants that ultimately died (TG5) continued to show a downward trend, while the expression leveled off after 10–15 days in severely ill participants who eventually recovered or stabilized (TG4) (Figure 3I; Table S5)."
37327781,19,Results || Targeted mass spectrometry-based classical plasma proteomics analysis,"Targeted.Prot.mod3 also contained proteins associated with the “coagulation” pathway (9/33 proteins) including the fibrinolysis inhibitor carboxypeptidase B2 (CPB2) in addition to proteins from the complement pathway (8/33 proteins) (Figure 3J). Like Targeted.Prot.mod1, the expression of Targeted.Prot.mod3 also differed significantly between TGs at visit 1 (adj.p = 1.32e−7; Figure 3K) and longitudinally (shape adj.p = 5.52e−15, average adj.p = 8.90e−25; Figure 3L). However, the abundance levels of the proteins in Targeted.Prot.mod3 at visit 1 and their dynamics were the opposite of those observed in Targeted.Prot.mod1, i.e., lower levels were associated with less severe disease manifestations and faster recovery (TG1–3) (Figure 3K). The lower abundances at visit 1 were followed by a steady decrease in their abundance in plasma over time (Figure 3L; Table S5). In contrast, the plasma concentrations from participants in TG5 showed a steep increase over time, demonstrating the importance of trajectory analyses to leverage the full prognostic value of plasma proteins. The plasma from participants in TG4 showed an intermediate trajectory: an elevated level near the time of hospital admission (visit 1) was followed by a slight decrease. However, concentrations diminish about 3 weeks after hospitalization, consistent with the delayed recovery of these severely ill COVID-19 participants (Figure 3L). Longitudinal analysis of the proteins associated with Targeted.Prot.mod1 and Targeted.Prot.mod3 showed opposing temporal trajectories for the different clinical trajectory groups as one would expect for stimulators and inhibitors of the same biological process such as fibrinolysis."
37327781,20,Results || Global mass spectrometry-based plasma proteome analysis,"To increase the depth of the plasma proteome, we biochemically depleted the most abundant plasma proteins from 1,309 plasma samples associated with 497 participants. The depleted plasma samples were trypsinized and analyzed using LC/MS-based shotgun proteomics (henceforth called “global” proteomics). We did not observe any batch effect using PVCA (Figure S5A) and PCA (Figure S5B) in this global proteomics dataset. We identified 2,109 proteins in total, 508 of which were present in at least 50% of the samples. WGCNA of the expression levels of these 508 proteins identified seven modules ranging in size from 23 to 89 proteins. With the exceptions of Global.prot.mod2 and Global.prot.mod7, the other five modules were significantly associated with clinical trajectory groups at visit 1 (Figure S5C)."
37327781,21,Results || Global mass spectrometry-based plasma proteome analysis,"The 27 proteins associated with Global.prot.mod4 were enriched in proteins associated with apical junctions (6/27 proteins), including myosins of cardiac (MYH7) as well as musculoskeletal origin (MYH1) (Figure 3M). Interestingly, the majority of the proteins in this module were exclusively observed after biochemical depletion of the most abundant proteins. Without such depletion of the most abundant plasma proteins, the proteins in Global.prot.mod4 would not be observable using the same analytical instrumentation."
37327781,22,Results || Global mass spectrometry-based plasma proteome analysis,"Participants with mild to moderate disease course (TG1–3) started out with significantly lower levels of Global.prot.mod4 than the participants with more severe disease trajectories (TG4–5) (adj.p = 2.68e−19, Figure 3N; Table S6). In addition, participants in TG1–3 showed a clear downward trend during recovery, i.e., further reduction of these markers for cardiac injury. This longitudinal pattern of Global.prot.mod4 proteins differentiated severely ill participants that eventually recovered (TG4), who shared a downward trend, from those with fatal outcomes (TG5), who had a continuous upward trend (shape adj.p = 4.53e−11; Figure 3O; Table S6). These trends suggest significant involvement and damage of heart and lung in the acute phase of the disease. Worsening myocardial injury is associated with increased epithelial damage, as indicated by markers of apical junction damage34 and epithelial-mesenchymal transition.35 This is consistent with the higher cardiac troponin levels, associated with myocardial injury, previously observed for the participants in the most severe trajectory group in the IMPACC cohort.11"
37327781,23,Results || Plasma global metabolomics reveals metabolic dysregulation in hospitalized participants,"Untargeted metabolomics using mass spectrometry (LC-MS) was performed on 1,275 plasma samples from 486 participants. After quality control and assurance procedures (Figures S6A–S6C), we identified 1,017 metabolite features based on their m/z ratio and retention time. PCA (Figure S6D) and PVCA identified event location (outpatient vs. inpatient, 11.5% variance for baseline, 10.5% variance for longitudinal analysis; Figure S6E) and body mass index (BMI; 14% variance for visit 1 analysis; Figure S6F) as accounting for a significant fraction of the variance. These factors were subsequently included as covariates in the longitudinal models. WGCNA identified 42 modules ranging from 5 to 296 metabolites (Figures S7A and S7B). Eighteen out of 42 modules measured at visit 1 were significantly associated with clinical outcome (Table S7). Seven of these modules demonstrated higher levels in participants with mild disease, while 11 modules were associated with severe disease (TG5). This included branched-chain aa and urea cycle metabolites (globalmet.mod6), phenylalanine and tyrosine metabolism (globalmet.mod35), and monoacylglycerol metabolism (globalmet.mod24). Interestingly, one of these modules, globalmet.mod6, consisted of branched aa and urea cycle metabolites (Figure 4A) and had a higher level in the more severe trajectory groups (Figure 4B; adj.p = 2.87e−13) raising the possibility of a role in disease severity. Consistent with this hypothesis, the module levels eventually decreased over time in the milder trajectory groups (TG1–4) but significantly increased across time in the most severe trajectory group (TG5) (shape adj.p = 2.95e−9, average adj.p = 4.3e−29) (Figure 4C). Longitudinal analysis also identified 26 additional modules with average or shape having a significant association with clinical trajectory group (Table S7). Among the most significant modules associated with trajectory groups, we identified globalmet.mod8, composed of many phospholipid metabolites including arachidonic acids (Figure 4D), as having higher concentration in participants with mild disease at hospital admission (Figure 4E; adj.p = 7.33e−5). This module also increased over time in all but the fatal group (TG5), where levels eventually decreased over time (Figure 4F; shape adj.p = 7.98e−4, average adj.p = 3.11e−8). We identified additional pathways such as histidine metabolism (globalmet.mod3) and glycerophospholipids (globalmet.mod21) that demonstrated the same decreasing pattern. Overall, this analysis identified significant dysregulation of the plasma metabolome associated with disease severity. Increases in plasma concentrations of branched-chain aa metabolites, including those within the histidine, lysine, urea, and tryptophan pathways, were associated with more severe disease trajectories (Figure S7C). In contrast, severe disease was also associated with lower and decreasing concentrations of phospholipid metabolites (Figure S7D).Figure 4Association of plasma metabolomics modules with clinical trajectory groups(A–F) Analysis of plasma metabolomics data identified significant levels of (A–C) globalmet.mod6 and (D–F) globalmet.mod8 among clinical trajectory groups.(A–C) Levels of globalmet.mod6, comprised of mostly branched amino acid and urea cycle metabolites, (A and B) at visit 1 and (C) over time.(D–F) Levels of globalmet.mod8, which is comprised of phospholipid metabolites, were associated with severity at (D and E) visit 1 (adj.p = 7.33e−5) and (F) longitudinally.(B and E) For each boxplot, the vertical line indicates the median, the box indicates the interquartile range, and the whiskers indicate 1.5 times the interquartile range."
37327781,24,"Results || Cell frequencies in blood of severe hospitalized COVID-19 participants show high frequencies of neutrophils and monocytes, with decreased cytotoxic NK cells","CyTOF profiling was performed on 811 blood samples collected from 371 participants. We used a panel of 43 antibodies designed to identify cell lineages and intracellular markers of functional status. Sixty-five cell subsets were identified in whole blood using a semi-automated gating strategy (Figure S8A). We did not detect any batch effect using PCA (Figure S8B) and PVCA (Figure S8C). The frequencies of 9 cell subsets measured at visit 1 were significantly associated with clinical outcome. Specifically, higher frequencies of lymphocytes, including T cells and NK cells, were associated with mild disease trajectories (TG1–3). In addition, higher frequencies of neutrophils, hematopoietic progenitor cells (adj.p = 6.34e−3; Figure 5A), and CD14+CD16− classical monocytes (CD14+CD16−: adj.p = 3.83e−4, CD14+CD16+: adj.p = 3.73e−4; Figure 5B) were associated with more severe disease trajectories. Some of these cell subsets also showed significant changes over time that were associated with clinical trajectory groups. Indeed, participants in the most severe trajectory group (TG5) had a higher frequency of neutrophils at admission (primarily driven by CD16hi neutrophils). While this subset tended to decrease over time, the CD16low neutrophils increased over time in the severe trajectory group (TG5) (Figure 5C). This contrasts with participants that recovered, who had either constant or decreasing frequencies of neutrophils (both CD16hi and CD16low) over time (CD16hi, average adj.p = 1.08e−3, shape adj.p = 6.62e−3; CD16low, average adj.p = 0.0113, shape adj.p = 0.0317; Figure 5C). The frequency of total CD4 and CD8 T cells increased over time in all trajectory groups except for the most severe trajectory group (CD4, average adj.p = 4,18e−9, shape adj.p = 0.0251; CD8, average adj.p = 1.15e−4, shape adj.p = 0.0105; Figure 5D; Table S8), which saw instead an increase of myeloid cells over time (Figure S8D). The increase of CD4 and CD8 T cells in those aforementioned trajectory groups was driven by increases among many of the CD4 and CD8 cell subsets including CD4 and CD8 naive T cells, effector memory CD4 and CD8 T cells, and regulatory T cells (Tregs). Longitudinal analysis also revealed that the frequency of cytotoxic NK cells producing granzyme B (CD56low, CD16hi, CD57low) increased over time in participants in TG1–4, while in the most severe trajectory group (TG5), cytotoxic NK cell frequencies decreased over time (shape adj.p = 7.08e−7; Figure 5E; Table S8). Altogether, we identified immune cells distinguishing the five clinical trajectory groups including an increase in hematopoietic progenitor cells and classical monocytes that was persistent over time in participants with the most severe disease course. The heightened frequency of hematopoietic progenitor cells may reflect the emergency hematopoiesis that occurs in the most severe participants, while heightened pro-inflammatory monocytes may reflect the sustained and uncontrolled inflammation exacerbated by severe COVID-19. We also identified lymphopenia, neutrophilia, and a decrease in cytotoxic NK cells as associated with COVID-19 disease severity.Figure 5Association of cell subset frequencies with clinical trajectory groups(A) Visit 1 analysis identified the frequency of hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) among non-granulocytes as different among clinical trajectory groups (adj.p = 6.34e−3), with higher average expression in the more severe groups.(B) The frequencies of CD14+CD16−, CD14+CD16+, and CD14dimCD16+ monocyte subsets among parental monocytes at visit 1.

Batch effects were assessed using PCA (Figures S9A and S9B) and PVCA (Figure S9C). WGCNA identified 40 modules ranging from 86 to 1,676 genes. Twenty-one of these modules measured at visit 1 were significantly associated with clinical trajectory groups (Figure S9D). Among these 21 modules, PBMC.mod2 (containing 802 genes) was enriched for several pathways that have previously been associated with COVID-19, including TNF-α signaling via nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) inflammatory response,36 IFN-γ response,37 and IL-6/JAK/STAT3 signaling38 (Figure 6A). This module showed higher expression at visit 1 in participants from the more severe trajectory groups (TG4-5; adj.p = 7.99e−3; Figure 6B; Table S9) and showed a statistically significant change in the shape of expression over time between the trajectory groups (shape adj.p = 0.025, average adj.p = 1.33e−10; Figure 6C).Figure 6Association of PBMC transcriptomic and nasal transcriptomic modules with clinical trajectory groups(A–I) Analysis of PBMC transcriptomic data identified 21 modules with significant differences in expression levels between clinical trajectory groups at visit 1, including (A–C) PBMC.mod2, (D–F) PBMC.mod14, and (G–I) PBMC.mod8.

37327781,26,Results || Analysis of PBMC transcriptomics highlights modules related to inflammation and immune cell differentiation,"A module with high statistical significance, both at visit 1 (adj.p = 1.78e−8) and longitudinally (shape adj.p = 1.64e−7, average adj.p = 2.77e−20), was PBMC.mod14, containing 356 genes. Enriched pathways for PBMC.mod14 included Th17 cell differentiation, Th1 and Th2 cell differentiation, T cell receptor signaling, and IL-2/STAT5 signaling36 (Figure 6D). PBMC.mod14 showed decreasing expression at visit 1 with increasing disease severity (Figure 6E). Additionally, this module showed increasing expression over time in trajectory groups that ultimately recovered (TG1–4) but decreasing expression in participants in the fatal trajectory group (TG5), suggesting a role in disease recovery (Figure 6F).37 PBMC.mod29 also contained genes relating to T cell receptor signaling (Figure 6D).38 PBMC.mod8 consisted of 416 genes with functions relating to TNF-α signaling via NF-κB and transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) signaling (Figure 6G). Higher expression of PBMC.mod8 (Table S9) at visit 1 was associated with milder disease trajectories (adj.p = 2.76e−4; Figure 6H). Like PBMC.mod14, the expression of PBMC.mod8 generally increased over time in all but the most severe trajectory group (TG5) with decreasing expression over time (shape adj.p = 0.03, average adj.p = 1.39e−9; Figure 6I)."
37327781,27,Results || Analysis of PBMC transcriptomics highlights modules related to inflammation and immune cell differentiation,"Interestingly, in multiple cases, the same pathway was found to be enriched in modules with opposing associations with trajectory group. For example, the TNF-α via NF-κB, IL-2/STAT5, and TCR signaling pathway genes that were part of PBMC.mod2 generally increased with trajectory group (at visit 1 and longitudinally). These same pathways have genes that were decreasing in PBMC.mod8 (TNF-α via NF-κB) and PBMC.mod14 (IL-2/STAT5 and TCR signaling). The genes driving each of these enrichments were distinct, as each gene is only associated with a single module (Figure S9E), and also reflected different biological mechanisms. Genes belonging to TNF-α via the NF-κB pathway in PBMC.mod2 were downstream of signaling from TNFR1 (TNF receptor 1), including the receptor itself, while only PBMC.mod8 genes were downstream of TNFR2 (Figure S10A). Overall, these results identify gene expression changes in multiple pathways associated with disease severity at both visit 1 and over time."
37327781,28,Results || Genetic associations with severe disease overlap previously reported Human Genome Initiative association,"To identify genetic determinants of severe disease, we generated a high-quality dataset of 466 participants genotyped at 1,060,358 common variants across the genome, including the X and Y chromosomes. After controlling for population stratification (genomic inflation factor λ = 0.98) and other quality assessment measures (Figures S11A–S11E), we performed a GWAS of severe illness (TG4–5 vs. TG1–3). Given the sample size and modest effect sizes of common variants, no marker reached the genome-wide significant threshold of p < 5 × 10−8 (Figure S11F). We were, however, able to replicate one of ten associations with COVID-19 hospitalization previously reported by the Human Genome Initiative43 (11-34528766-C-T, p = 0.03; Table S10), which was linked to a role for ELF5, a transcription factor active in epithelial cells. This observation suggested that the genetic basis of severe disease in our cohort is similar to that reported by the HGI.44"
37327781,29,Results || Dysregulated airway epithelial barrier functions relate to disease severity and mortality,"We generated host transcriptional profiles from nasal swab samples to assess the upper airway mucosal responses, the initial site of SARS-CoV-2 infection and first line of barrier and immunologic defense to the virus. RNA-seq data was generated for 1,078 nasopharyngeal swab samples collected from 451 participants. After correcting for technical covariates (plate and median CV), PCA (Figure S12A) and PVCA did not reveal any batch effects (Figures S12B and S12C). WGCNA identified eight modules with size ranging from 92 to 1,761 genes (Figure S12D). Overall, the expressions of three out of eight modules were significantly associated with clinical outcome at visit 1, and six modules were associated with clinical outcome on the longitudinal pattern. NasalRNASeq.mod1 was enriched for genes related to multiple innate immune signaling pathways including neutrophil activation, IL-6, IL-1, TNF-α, Toll-like receptors, and type 1 and type 2 IFN signaling, among others, and was higher in participants with more severe disease trajectories (TG4–5) (Figure S12E). The NasalRNASeq.mod3 was enriched for genes involved in extracellular matrix formation including fibronectin 1 (FN1), periostin (POSTN), and 16 collagen genes and also enriched in genes associated with cell-cell adhesion and epithelial mesenchymal transition (Figure 6J). Expression of this module was increased in more severe trajectory groups (TG4 and TG5) at visit 1 (Figure 6K) and decreased over time in all groups but the most severe trajectory group (TG5), where the opposite pattern was observed (shape adj.p = 0.004, average adj.p = 3.08e−13; Figure 6L; Table S11), suggesting a role in disease severity. NasalRNASeq.mod4 was enriched for genes involved in epithelial cornification including filaggrin (FLG), SPINK5, and 11 keratin genes and was also enriched in serine-type peptidases including tissue kallikreins (Figure 6M). In contrast, the expression of NasalRNASeq.mod4 was lower in participants in the more severe trajectory groups (TG4 and TG5) (Figure 6N) and decreased over time, specifically in TG5 (shape adj.p = 0.018, average adj.p = 0.07; Figure 6O; Table S11). Overall, this analysis identified significant dysregulation of airway epithelial barrier responses that were associated with disease severity and mortality. In particular, a multi-faceted inflammatory response occurs directly in the airway in severe COVID-19 as well as increased expression of extracellular matrix, adhesion, and collagen genes that may represent the initial cellular damage driving severe inflammation."
37327781,30,Results || Analysis of upper airway metagenomics reveals abundance in anaerobes in more severe trajectory group,"In our previous publication describing clinical features of the entire IMPACC cohort, we noted differences in bacterial infections based on trajectory group, with bacteremia clinically reported in a higher proportion of participants in TG4 (45/212, 21%) and TG5 (28/108, 26%) than TG1–3 (40/844, 4.7%). Here, we performed meta-transcriptomic analysis on the same host nasal RNA-seq data generated from 1,077 nasopharyngeal samples collected from 451 participants. PCA (Figures S13G and S13H), non-metric Bray-Curtis dissimilarity analysis, and PVCA did not reveal any batch effects (Figure S13I). There was no significant association of bacterial abundance (Figure S13A) or α diversity (Figure S13B) with clinical trajectory either at visit 1 or longitudinally. The relative abundance of bacterial genera at visit 1 also showed no significant associations with clinical trajectory. However, the longitudinal patterns of 22 bacterial genera were significantly associated with clinical outcome (Table S12). The relative abundance of anaerobic bacteria including Bacteroides spp. (shape adj.p = 0.038, average adj.p = 5.4e−4; Figure S13C), Fusobacterium spp. (shape adj.p = 0.25, average adj.p = 0.001; Figure S13D), and Prevotella spp. (shape adj.p = 0.0501, average adj.p = 5.4e−4; Figure S13E) was higher overall in more severe trajectory groups, and the expression of these bacterial genera increased over time in the most severe trajectory group (TG5). In contrast, the relative abundance of 10 bacterial genera, including the well-known commensal Cutibacterium spp., was lower overall and further decreased over time in the most severe trajectory group (TG5) (shape adj.p = 0.16, average adj.p = 1.7e−5; Figure S13F). Overall, this analysis identified temporal changes in the relative abundance of multiple bacterial taxa that were associated with disease severity and mortality. These changes in upper airway microbial communities may influence inflammatory signaling or viral replication."
37327781,31,Results || Overlap across data types reveals consistent pathways associated with disease severity,"The analysis of each assay identified many modules that were significantly associated with clinical TG, both at visit 1 and longitudinally. We assessed the overlap of pathways that were enriched in these modules to identify common biological processes across data types (e.g., mRNA and protein) and tissues (i.e., blood and upper airways). Among the modules that were significantly associated with TGs at visit 1, 37 pathway annotations were enriched in multiple data types (Figure 7A). The most overlapping annotation was related to monocytes/macrophages and was associated with PBMC transcriptomics and blood CyTOF as well as Olink. This included genes coding for myeloid cell-specific markers CD93 and Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and the soluble proteins CCL4 (MIP-1β) and TNFSF14 (LIGHT), known to activate macrophages and abrogate T cell responses, as well as elevated frequencies of monocytes among the most severe COVID-19 cases.45,46,47 In general, overlapping annotations were shared between PBMC and upper airway transcriptional responses. Pathways related to cell cycle and cell migration were perturbed in both tissue compartments. In the upper airway, higher expression of these modules was generally associated with more severe disease trajectory groups, suggesting more active, localized responses in severe disease. Common pathways enriched among modules identified in the longitudinal (shape) analysis highlighted additional disease-associated perturbations (Figure 7B). In particular, inflammatory responses and T cell-associated pathways were observed in both PBMC and upper airway transcriptomics assays. The positive and negative associations of T cell-associated pathways with severe disease in the upper airways and blood, respectively, may reflect the migration of these subsets out of the blood. Two pathways (xenobiotic metabolism and complement) were observed in four separate assays: PBMC and upper airway transcriptomics along with targeted and global proteomics. The association of xenobiotic metabolism was driven by multiple genes (CYP1B1, ALDH2, and CES1 were part of PBMC.mod18) and proteins (APOE part of Targeted.Prot.mod4 and CRP part of the Global.prot.mod3) in the pathway. The association of xenobiotic metabolism with increased severity is likely a reflection of the large metabolomic reprogramming experienced by severe COVID-19 participants. The association of complement was driven by multiple genes (CR1, C5AR2, C5AR1 part of the PBMC.mod2 and genes CD40LG part of the NasalRNAseq.mod6) and proteins (CP, CFB, C9 part of the Targeted.Prot.mod3 and Global.prot.mod3). Complement activation products orchestrate a pro-inflammatory environment that contributes to the maintenance of a severe inflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2 and is likely to cause several of the symptoms observed after infection.Figure 7Markers of disease severity overlapping across assaysOverlapping pathways associated with more moderate or more severe trajectory groups (A) at the time of hospitalization (visit 1; left) or (B) during the longitudinal follow up during the acute phase of the disease (right). For each overlapping pathway (row), the assays contributing to its identification as a marker of COVID-19 disease severity (column) are indicated.

37327781,32,Discussion,"For a comprehensive profile of acute COVID-19, we have undertaken unbiased large-scale transcriptomic, proteomic, metabolomic, cytometric, serologic, genomic, microbiome, and viral state analyses of 540 hospitalized COVID-19 participants, recruited from 20 hospitals associated with 15 biomedical centers, who were longitudinally followed up to 28 days post-admission. Major advantages of IMPACC include the prospective enrollment of diverse adult populations from across the US and sample sparing assays of blood and tissue/fluids using comprehensive molecular omics methods. Additionally, the collection of extensive clinical data allows for identification of five distinct clinical trajectories that discriminated ranges of respiratory disease severity.11 This clinical phenotyping has advantages over conventional cross-sectional assessments by fully leveraging longitudinal data indicative of respiratory illness severity to characterize a participant’s outcomes during hospitalization, from mild respiratory disease (TG1) to severe respiratory disease ending in death (TG5). Using this systems analysis approach, we both confirm the findings of immune dysregulation from smaller, cross-sectional cohorts as well as identify cellular and soluble factors, at hospital admission and longitudinally, that are associated with disease severity and death from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Higher viral load and elevated inflammatory pathways in the airway are linked to more severe COVID-19 in this cohort."
37327781,33,Discussion,"Further characterization of molecular factors that are associated with disease trajectories enable identification of distinct cellular and molecular mechanisms that contribute to a fatal outcome. A primary finding is the association of delayed viral clearance with death, despite detectable antibody responses, which suggests ongoing viral replication and potential differences in antibody quality or functionality in those with fatal outcomes. While antibody quality and functionality were not directly assessed, individuals who died exhibited increased seroreactivity to the NTD of S and decreased reactivity to the LINK domain of N. In addition, consistent with prior studies,2 participants with more severe COVID-19 had neutralizing autoantibodies (auto-Abs) against type I IFNs (TG4 = 9.6%, TG5 = 7.8%) that may contribute to the severity of disease in these individuals."
37327781,34,Discussion,"Lack of direct correspondence between viral loads and anti-viral antibody response suggests that dysregulation in other elements of the immune response plays a role in fatal cases.2 Immuno-profiling of innate and adaptive leukocyte subsets in blood using CyTOF and RNA-seq reveals that the most severe trajectory group (TG5) had a lower frequency of granzyme B-producing cytotoxic NK cells and lower expression of cytotoxic gene pathways. NK cells kill virally infected cells,48 and reduced levels of these cells may contribute to the viral persistence in TG5. Notably, analysis of cytokine/chemokine expression (Olink) identified a significant increase of activators of cytotoxic NK cells, including IL-12B and the immunoregulatory signaling molecule CD244, in less severe infection.49 We also found decreased phospholipid components, including phosphatidylcholines, associated with more severe disease trajectories. Phosphatidylcholines contribute to the formation of the immunological synapse, macrophage activation, NK cell function and T and B cell activity50,51 underlying severe/fatal disease,49,50 suggesting a role for these metabolites in regulating anti-viral immunity and promoting protection from severe disease. In summary, our results identified a deficiency of NK cell subsets and activity that could lead to impaired viral clearance as a mechanism underlying severe/fatal COVID-19."
37327781,35,Discussion,"More severe disease trajectories were associated with the activity of multiple pro-inflammatory pathways at baseline, and this activity persisted in people who did not survive the infection (TG5). Active pathways include TNF-α signaling via NF-κB, IL-6 signaling, and the IL-6/Jak/STAT3 pathway as noted previously in smaller cross-sectional studies.52 Genes contained within the TNF-α signaling pathway that displayed both increased gene expression at the initial visit and increasing expression over time in TG5 were found exclusively in genes known to be downstream of the TNFR1, but not TNFR2, including TNFR1 itself. Among genes downstream of TNFR1, c-FLIP, which functions to inhibit apoptosis and stimulate inflammatory components of the TNF-α signaling pathway,53 was also increased in expression in TG5. Inflammatory cell death induced by TNF and IFN-γ signaling has been linked to COVID-19 mortality.54 Supporting this pro-inflammatory role of the TNF signaling pathway is the combined expression of leukocyte recruitment factors CXCL1/2/3. Additionally, contained in PBMC.mod8 (showing decreasing expression in TG5) is c-Jun, a transcription factor that activates pro-apoptotic genes. These key components of the TNF pathway, though enriched in modules showing opposite expression trajectories, show that anti-apoptosis and pro-inflammatory mechanisms are activated in more severe trajectory groups. These inflammatory cytokines can recruit pro-inflammatory innate immune cells including monocytes and neutrophils, which will amplify inflammatory pathways leading to a “cytokine storm.”"
37327781,36,Discussion,"Our results reveal a hyperinflammatory state across the airway and systemically as a correlate of severe infection and death. CyTOF analysis also shows a greater frequency of neutrophils in the more severe trajectory groups 4 and 5, a marker of severe COVID-19 outcome as noted previously55,56 and possibly reflecting secondary bacterial infection.57 Neutrophil influx into the lung may damage lung epithelial cells and contribute to lung pathology, which may be amplified by release of NETs and neutrophil granule contents. In addition, cytokine/chemokine assays (Olink) identified multiple modules associated with disease severity including cytokines produced by neutrophils, pro-inflammatory modules, and activators of macrophages. Inflammatory biomarkers, including IL-6, were higher at baseline in both TG4 and TG5 compared with milder disease, similar to previous findings.58 Longitudinal Olink measurements suggest a clear association between resolution of inflammation in 28-day survivors (TG1-4) vs. non-survivors (TG5), confirming the value of evaluating both clinical outcomes and measures of inflammation over time rather than in a cross-sectional fashion. Elevated products of neutrophils identified by nasal and blood RNA-seq are all associated with TG4 and TG5 and remained elevated over time. Examining metabolite profiles, we identified plasma branched-chain aa (BCAA) and urea components as significantly elevated at baseline and further increased over time with severe trajectories. Increased BCAA components enhance reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, endothelial cell pro-inflammatory activities,59,60 and insulin resistance.61 Histidine and lysine residues, often found in viral envelope proteins, play roles in the activation of serine proteases assisting viral entry to host cells.62,63 RNA-seq analysis of upper airway samples identified that severe/fatal disease is associated with higher initial and increased subsequent expression of genes related to extracellular matrix formation and cell adhesion, including fibronectin.64,65 These findings suggest a potential etiology for our plasma proteome results that demonstrated thrombosis.64,65 Our data suggest that in severe COVID-19, adverse remodeling of the airway epithelium, the first line of barrier and immunologic defense against respiratory viruses and the initial site of infection for SARS-CoV-2, may initiate a prothrombotic state systemically.53,54,55"
37327781,37,Discussion,"Increased plasma concentrations of various myosin chains of cardiac and/or musculoskeletal origin were detected in the most severely ill COVID-19 participants. This provides evidence for damage to skeletal and cardiac muscle tissues in severe COVID-19 and might reflect damage to the blood vessels and myocardium, as well as muscle breakdown from a catabolic stress response. Muscle damage is associated with a poor prognosis in COVID-19.66 In our study, all COVID-19 participants that eventually recovered (TG1–4) show a slight increase or steady state of plasma fibrinolysis stimulators and coagulation inhibitors. Coagulation is a carefully balanced counterplay of thrombosis (blood clot formation) and fibrinolysis (breakdown of blood clots). The observed relationship between a massively dysregulated coagulation cascade and disease severity is consistent with the widely reported blood clotting complications in COVID-19 participants. For example, elevated plasma levels of D-dimer, a fibrin-degradation product, are a marker of increased risk of severe disease and mortality.67"
37327781,38,Discussion,"Changes in the respiratory microbiome may moderate inflammatory gene expression, immune signaling, and viral replication. We found an enrichment of anaerobes in the genera Prevotella and Bacteroides in the upper airways of participants with more severe trajectories. Conversely, we found that commensal C. spp. were enriched in participants with milder trajectories, whereas loss of these species over time was associated with fatal disease. These results suggest a possible role for some taxa in disease pathogenesis, or alternatively, they may reflect disruption of the upper airway microbiome resulting from the host immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. The observations may also, in part, reflect greater exposure of those with more severe COVID-19 to antibiotics.68 Future work can extend these observations to both build improved prognostic models and understand the specific contributions of these taxa to respiratory tract inflammation and viral replication."
37327781,39,Discussion,"Our study also identified elements that may be protective from severe disease. Notably, in the upper airway epithelium, mild disease was associated with higher expression of genes related to epithelial cornification typically seen in squamous epithelium, whereas this pathway declined significantly in fatal disease. Given that SARS-CoV-2 does not replicate significantly in squamous epithelium and that multi-ciliated cells are the primary site of SARS-CoV-2 infection,69,70 this finding suggests a protective response mediated via epithelial reprogramming toward squamous cells that can generate local anti-viral responses.68 This finding is also consistent with the higher viral load and prolonged viral shedding associated with fatal disease. Additionally, we identified genes from PBMC pathways related to T cell receptor signaling, in which Th1, Th2, and Th17 cell differentiation was increased in disease recovery groups (TG1–4). These findings are consistent with observations of lymphopenia in COVID-19 cases71 and later findings that altered T cell activity and decreased abundance were also associated with severe disease.3"
37327781,40,Discussion,"Overall, our study featured multiple strengths, including (1) a large, geographical diverse cohort compared with most COVID-19 studies employing omics approaches, (2) longitudinal design with extensive clinical data capture, (3) immunophenotyping employing 14 assay types, and (4) rigorous data management, quality control and assurance, and a standardized analysis pipeline. This comprehensive approach enabled deep immunophenotyping of the acute phase of COVID-19 from 540 hospitalized participants enrolled in the IMPACC cohort and identified several significant associations with clinical course. Specifically, we identified decreases in activators of NK cells and phospholipid metabolites, increased blood neutrophils, increased circulating myosins that may indicate muscle damage, changes in the cells that line the airways (epithelial reprogramming), and an increased abundance of anaerobes in the airway of participants the succumbed to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Broadly, these results point to heightened levels of viremia driving an inflammatory response locally and systemically, leading to impaired anti-viral innate and adaptive immunity as well dysregulation in metabolic pathways in participants with severe disease trajectories. While many of the perturbed pathways were observed in multiple assays, most were unique to a single assay, highlighting the utility of a multi-omics approach."
37327781,41,Discussion || Limitations of the study,"While featuring multiple strengths, potential limitations of our study include (1) the identification of associations but not cause-effect relationships, (2) the lack of immunophenotyping of the pre-infection biologic state, which could influence disease progression, or healthy control participants for comparison, (3) the exclusion of pregnant women and children,10 and (4) the timing of cohort enrollment before vaccination or the widespread circulation of important variants, including SARS-CoV-2 B.1.617.2 (Delta) and B.1.1.529 (Omicron). While this study employed a common analytic strategy across modalities and tissues, allowing the identification of likely shared biological drivers, modules were defined separately for each assay and were analyzed independently. An alternate analysis that starts by defining multi-omics modules as the unit for analysis would allow for the direct identification of correlations between features and associated pathways. In some cases where common pathways were identified by multiple assays (Figure 7), their association with severe disease was discordant. In these cases, it is possible that distinct components of the pathway drive significance in each assay (e.g., up-regulation of inhibitory cytokines and down-regulation of the associated pathway) or that the changes reflect cell migration (e.g., migration of activated cells from blood to the upper airways). Some of the associations with COVID-19 disease severity may also be confounded by clinical treatment (e.g., medications administered to manage COVID-19). However, the analysis of the entire IMPACC cohort did not detect any impact of either remdesivir or systemic corticosteroid use on nasal viral load or SARS-CoV-2 serology titers.11 Future analysis of the full IMPACC cohort with deep immunophenotyping data may allow for an assessment of the effect of medications."

37327781,47,STAR★Methods || Experimental model and study subject details || IMPACC cohort characteristics,"The IMPACC cohort enrolled participants from 20 hospitals affiliated with 15 geographically distributed academic institutions across the U.S. Eligible participants were patients hospitalized with symptoms or signs consistent with COVID-19, which had SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by RT-PCR to remain in the study. The detailed study design, schedule for clinical data, biological sample collection and demographic information about the participants were previously described.10,11 Briefly, detailed clinical assessments and nasal, blood, and endotracheal aspirates (intubated participants only) were collected within 72h of hospitalization (visit 1) and on days 4, 7, 14, 21, 28 after hospital admission (visits 2–6, respectively). If a participant required escalation of care or was re-admitted to the hospital prior to Day 28, additional samples were collected within 24 and 96 h of care escalation or readmission. If participants were discharged prior to day 14 or 28, attempts were made to collect limited clinical information and biologic samples on days 14 and/or 28 in outpatients. Disease severity was assessed using a 7-point ordinal scale based on degree of respiratory illness,10 modified from Beigel et al."

37327781,49,STAR★Methods || Method details || Sample processing and batch randomization,"Biological sample collection and processing followed a standard protocol utilized by every participating academic institution. The complete IMPACC sample processing protocol was published previously.10 To mitigate potential batching effects, a randomization procedure was developed to help ensure that longitudinal samples from the same individuals were run on the same plates and were randomly distributed across the plates. We stratified this randomization by disease severity (mild/moderate versus severe) and age (younger versus older) with the representation of these strata across plates. In addition, we verified that race, ethnicity, gender, and site were well represented across the plates."

37327781,52,STAR★Methods || Method details || RNA-sequencing cDNA library production,"From each nasal RNA sample, 10ul was aliquoted to a library construction plate using the Perkin Elmer Janus Workstation (Perkin Elmer, Janus II). Ribosomal depletion, cDNA synthesis, and library construction steps were performed using the Total Stranded RNA Prep with Ribo-Zero Plus kit, following the manufacturer’s instructions (Illumina). All steps were automated on the Perkin Elmer Sciclone NGSx Workstation to reduce batch-to-batch variability and increase sample throughput. Final cDNA libraries were quantified using the Quant-it dsDNA High Sensitivity assay, and library insert size distribution was checked using a fragment analyzer (Advanced Analytical; kit ID DNF474). Samples, where adapter dimers constituted more than 4% of the electropherogram area, were failed before sequencing. Technical controls (K562, Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat# AM7832) were compared to expected results to ensure that batch to batch variability was minimized. Successful libraries were normalized to 10nM for sequencing."
37327781,53,STAR★Methods || Method details || RNA-sequencing clustering and sequencing,Barcoded libraries were pooled using liquid handling robotics prior to loading. Massively parallel sequencing-by-synthesis with fluorescently labeled reversibly terminating nucleotides was carried out on the NovaSeq 6000 sequencer using S4 flowcells with a target depth of 50 million 100 base-pair paired-end reads per sample (25 million read pairs).
37327781,54,STAR★Methods || Method details || Nasal viral genome sequencing and assembly,"For viral genome sequencing,76 cDNA synthesis was performed with random hexamers and ProtoScript II (New England Biolabs, E6560) starting from 7 μL of total RNA extracted from clinical specimens. The SARS-CoV-2 genome was then amplified with Q5 Hot Start High-Fidelity DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs, cat. M0493) using two sets of custom-designed tiling primers generating overlapping amplicons of ∼1.5 and 2 kb. The PCR amplification parameters were: 1 min at 98C, 35 cycles of 15 s at 98C and 5 min at 63C, and final extension for 10 min at 65C. After equivolume pooling of the amplicons and cleanup with 1.8X volume of Ampure XT beads, libraries were prepared using the Nextera XT DNA Sample Preparation kit (Illumina, FC-131-1096), followed by paired-end sequencing (2 × 150nt) on the Illumina MiSeq platform. A custom reference-based analysis pipeline, https://github.com/mjsull/COVID_pipe, was used to assemble SARS-CoV-2 genomes. Whole-genome viral amplification was initially conducted on 1,154 nasopharyngeal swab samples collected from 474 participants, of which 531 samples had a detectable PCR band to attempt sequencing. Of these samples, 316 yielded complete viral genomes from 221 participants."
37327781,55,STAR★Methods || Method details || Antibody correlates: titers || Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA),"Antibodies antibody levels against the recombinant receptor-binding domain (RBD) and full-length spike were measured using a research-grade ELISA as described.122,123 Briefly, samples were heat-inactivated at 56°C for 1 h. 96-well plates (Thermo Fisher Lot # 4199147) were coated with 50 μL/well of RBD or spike proteins at 2 μg/mL concentration in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; Gibco lot # 2388102) and incubated overnight at 4°C. Plates were washed 3× in an automatic plate washer (BioTek) with PBS 0.01% Tween 20 (Fisher Scientific, Cat#BP337-100, TPBS) and blocked for 1 h with 200 μL/well of 3% non-fat dry milk (Cat#AB10109-01000) prepared in TPBS. Serum samples were serially diluted (3-fold starting at 1:80 dilution) in 1% non-fat dry milk in TPBS. The blocking solution was removed, and 100 μL/well of serially diluted samples were added to the plates and incubated for 2h at 20°C. Plates were washed 3× with TPBS, and 50 μL/well of the corresponding secondary antibody, prepared in 1% non-fat dry milk in TPBS, were added for 1h at RT: Anti-human IgG (Fc specific)-Peroxidase antibody produced in goat (Sigma-Aldrich Cat#A0170); Goat anti-human IgM-HRP (SouthernBiotech Cat#2020–05); Anti-human IgA (α-chain specific)-Peroxidase antibody produced in goat (Sigma-Aldrich Cat#A0295).

Optical density (OD) was measured in a Synergy 4 (BioTek) plate reader at 490 nm. The area under the curve was calculated, considering 0.15 OD as the cutoff. Data were analyzed using Graphpad Prism 9."
37327781,56,STAR★Methods || Method details || SARS-CoV-2 recombinant RBD and spike proteins,"Recombinant RBD and spike proteins of SARS-CoV-2 were generated and expressed as previously described.124 Briefly, constructs consisted of mammalian-cell codon-optimized nucleotide sequences for RBD (amino acids 319–541), including a signal peptide and hexahistidine tag, or the soluble version of the spike protein (amino acids 1–1,213) with a signal peptide, C-terminal thrombin cleavage site, T4 fold-on trimerization domain, and hexahistidine tag. These sequences were cloned into the mammalian expression vector pCAGGS. The nucleotide sequence of the spike protein was additionally modified to remove the polybasic cleavage site, and two stabilizing mutations (K986P and V987P) were introduced. The expression plasmids are available at BEI Resources Repository (https://www.beiresources.org/). Recombinant proteins were produced in Expi293F cells (Thermo Fisher) using the ExpiFectamine 293 Transfection Kit (Thermo Fisher) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Expi293F cells (Gibco #A14527) were cultured in Expi293 Expression Medium before transfection as described previously121 and in SARS-CoV-2 recombinant RBD and spike proteins method section. Expi293F cells were not authenticated and tested negative for mycoplasma. Proteins were purified by gravity flow using Ni-NTA Agarose (Qiagen) and concentrated in Amicon centrifugal units (EMD Millipore). Purified proteins were analyzed by reducing sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS–PAGE), and correct folding was confirmed by performing ELISAs with RBD-specific monoclonal antibody CR3022."
37327781,57,STAR★Methods || Method details || Autoantibody screening assay,"Samples were screened for autoantibodies2 against type I IFNs in a multiplex, particle-based assay, in which differentially fluorescing magnetic beads were covalently coupled to recombinant human proteins (2.5 μg/reaction). Beads were combined and incubated with 1:100 diluted serum samples for 30 min. Each sample was tested once with a random assortment in each plate tested in duplicate to ensure minimal intra-assay variability. Beads were washed then incubated with PE-labeled goat anti-human IgG (1ug/mL) for an additional 30 min. Beads were washed again and run on a BioPlex X200 instrument in a multiplex assay. Participant samples with a fluorescence intensity greater than 3 standard deviations above the mean of 1099 healthy controls at the earliest timepoint received (>1310 FI for IFNa; >386 FI for IFNb; >1387 for IFNw) were tested for blocking activity in the pSTAT1 functional assay."
37327781,58,STAR★Methods || Method details || pSTAT1 functional assay,"The blocking activity of anti-IFN-containing serum was determined by assessing STAT1 phosphorylation in healthy control cells following stimulation with the appropriate cytokine in the presence of 10% healthy control or participant serum.2 Surface-stained healthy control PBMCs (350,000/reaction) were cultured in serum-free RPMI medium with 10% healthy control (pooled human AB serum) or participant serum and were either left unstimulated or stimulated with IFNa, IFNw, or IFNb (10 ng/mL) for 15 min at 37°C. Cells were fixed, permeabilized, and stained for intranuclear phopsho-STAT1 (Y701). Cells were acquired on a BD LSR Fortessa cytometer with gating on CD14+ monocytes and analyzed with FlowJo software. A stimulation index was calculated for each sample by dividing the geometric mean fluorescence for the pSTAT1 channel for each stimulated condition by that of the unstimulated condition. The stimulation index for each cytokine was then normalized to that of the healthy control serum from the same assay, generating a normalized stimulation index (where >65% pSTAT1 = NOT blocking; 20–65% pSTAT1 = partially blocking; <20% pSTAT1 = blocking). Statistical analyses were performed using Fisher’s exact test of the overall association of autoantibodies among all 5 TGs."

All open reading frames for each virus were divided into sequences of 38mer peptides, with consecutive peptides sharing a 19 amino acid overlap. All peptide sequences were collapsed on 99% amino acid sequence identity using cd-hit. A subsequent patch of spike peptides was added to the library to account for variation in the spike protein. All spike protein sequences present in NCBI databases, including the SARS-CoV-2 allele used to generate the initial library, were downloaded (as of 10/02/2020), aligned, and divided into 38mers with a 19 amino acid overlap as already described. Only peptides with >3 amino acid differences (<92% sequence similarity) were retained and added to the library. The combined set of peptide sequences was converted to DNA sequences using an R language script, randomizing codon selection. Twenty-one (21) nucleotide 5′ linker sequences, as well as a nucleic acid sequence encoding an FLAG tag (DYKDDDDK) at the 3′ end of each oligonucleotide sequence, were added. The final oligonucleotide sequences were 159 nucleotides in length, outputted to a FASTA file, and sent to Twist Biosciences for synthesis. A single vial of 10pmoles of lyophilized DNA was received from Twist. The lyophilized oligonucleotides were resuspended in 10mM Tris/1mM EDTA (TE) to a final concentration of 0.2nM and PCR amplified for cloning into T7 phage vector arms (Novagen/EMD Millipore, Inc)."
37327781,60,STAR★Methods || Method details || Preparation of phage libraries,"Phage libraries were prepared and amplified fresh from packaging reactions. To prepare phage libraries, a 300 mL culture of E. coli BLT5403 was incubated at 37°C with shaking until the mid-log phase, defined as OD600 = 0.4. The culture was then inoculated at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.001 and incubated at 37°C for 2.5 h or until complete lysis was observed, after which 5M NaCl was added to the lysate for stabilization, and the lysate was placed on ice. The lysate was then spun at 8000 g for 15 min to pellet cellular debris. The phage-containing supernatant was 0.2uM filtered, and 5X PEG/NaCl (PEG-8000 20%, NaCl 2.5 mM) added to a final 1X concentration and incubated overnight at 4°C. The PEG-phage lysate mix was centrifuged for 15 min at 4000 g at 4°C, and the pellet was resuspended in storage media (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 6 mM MgCl2) before 0.22μM filtration. Phage libraries were titered by plaque assay and adjusted to a working concentration of 1010 pfu/mL before incubation with participant sera.

37327781,61,STAR★Methods || Method details || Serum proximity extension assay (olink),"Study samples were assayed in plate batch layouts following a centralized randomized scheme described above. Three samples (IMPACC_Serum, IMPACC_Plasma, and IMPACC_Plasma_Stim) were used as IMPACC inter-plate references (Reference samples)] in every plate. All samples (participant sera and reference) were subjected to PEA (Olink) multiplex assay Inflammatory panel (Olink Bioscience, Uppsala, Sweden), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. This inflammatory panel included 92 proteins associated with human inflammatory conditions. An incubation master mix containing pairs of oligonucleotide-labeled antibodies to each protein was added to the samples and incubated for 16 h at 4°C. Each protein was targeted with two different epitope-specific antibodies, increasing the assay’s specificity. The presence of the target protein in the sample brought the partner probes in close proximity, allowing the formation of a double-strand oligonucleotide polymerase chain reaction (PCR) target. On the following day, the extension master mix in the sample initiated the specific target sequences to be detected and generated amplicons using PCR in 96 well plates. For the detection of the specific protein, Dynamic array integrated fluidic Circuit (IFC) 96 × 96 chip was primed, loaded with 92 protein-specific primers, and mixed with sample amplicons, including three inter-plate controls (IPS) and three negative controls (NC). Real-time microfluidic qPCR was performed in Biomark (Fluidigm, San Francisco, CA) for the target protein quantification."

Proteins were eluted from the μSPE HLB plate with 100 μL of 90% acetonitrile and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. After elution, the samples were dried with a Speedvac, resuspended with 35 μL of 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate, and digested with 10 μL trypsin (500 ng) overnight at 37°C. Digestion was stopped by the addition of 5 μL 10% formic acid. The samples were stored at −80°C before LC/MS analysis. Two microliters of tryptic peptides were loaded onto Evotips and analyzed using an Evosep ONE liquid chromatography system (EVOSEP, Odense, Denmark) connected to a timsTOF Pro mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics, Billerica, MA, USA). The Evosep ONE was set to 60 samples per day, and the mass spectrometer was operated in DDA-PASEF mode. DDA-PASEF parameters were set as follows: m/z range 100–1700, the mobility (1/K0) range was set to 0.70–1.45 Vs./cm2, and the accumulation time was set to 100 ms."
37327781,63,STAR★Methods || Method details || Plasma targeted proteomics,"All chemicals and reagents were purchased at the highest purities available.

The samples were transferred to the SP3 beads mixture (Sera-Mag SpeedBeads, 1:1 v/v, GE Healthcare) previously washed with HPLC water (scale 1:10 protein to beads). Then a volume of 150 μL of absolute ethanol (Supelco) was added, and the mix was incubated for 15 min on a thermomixer (1,000 rpm at room temperature). The samples were placed on the magnetic rack, and the clear supernatant was removed. The beads were washed in three cycles in 200 μL of 80% ethanol. After the final washing step, the samples were trypsinized using 100 μL of trypsin buffer (Promega, 20 μg/mL in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate) and placed on a thermomixer (1,000 rpm, 2 h, 37°). After digestion, the samples were centrifuged to pulldown the liquid and placed on a magnetic rack to collect the supernatant and were then acidified with 2% v/v formic acid in HPLC water (Sigma Aldrich). The C18 cleanup was performed using a 96-well MACROSPIN C18 plate (TARGA, The NestGroup Inc.), and the tryptic peptides were eluted off the C18 particles using 40% ACN/0.1% FA. The samples were dried and stored at −20°C until LC/MS analysis.127 The samples were analyzed using an LC system (Nexera Mikros, Shimadzu) equipped with a Capillary C18 column (0.2 × 100mm, 2.7um particle diameter, Shimadzu) coupled online to an 8060 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer instrument (Shimadzu). From each sample, 1 μg peptide quantity was separated using a non-linear gradient over a 15-min run time operated at 10 μL/min (5% solvent B for 0.2 min; 5 to 40%B for 10.3 min; 85%B for 1.5 min and 5% for 3 min). The final scheduling method was performed using the following parameters: 1.2 s of maximum loop time with minimum dwell time of 2 msec and pause time of 1 msec, Q1 and Q3 resolution set at the ‘unit’ level."

The PROT-1 fixed whole blood samples were processed in batches of 20 samples. Due to sample quality issues, some samples remained pink or red after the barcoding step; those samples were discarded, and the remaining samples were pooled for the remaining staining steps. After staining was completed, the pooled sample was counted and split into 2–3 subsamples to be frozen as FBS/DMSO samples stored at −80C until the day of acquisition. On the day of acquisition, the Helios instrument was tuned according to the manufacturer’s software standards; if the signal of Tb159 or Tm169 from the Fluidigm Tuning Solution was more than 10% lower than previous days, the process was repeated until the margin was achieved. The final Tuning results were exported as a CSV from the software for the record."

One CSB subsample was washed twice in MilliQ water, or Fluidigm Cell Acquisition Solution then resuspended to 7–8 x 105/mL in CAS or MilliQ containing a 10-fold dilution of Fluidigm EQ 4-Element normalization beads and acquired on the tuned Helios instrument using either the PSI or SuperSampler for sample introduction. This dilution was chosen to give approximately 250–350 events/sec acquisition rate. The next CSB subsample or FBS/DMSO subsample was processed when the previous sample had less than 1mL of sample remaining. The instrument was cleaned with Fluidigm Wash Solution whenever clogging occurred, or approximately every 2 × 106 cell events were acquired. These cleaning steps resulted in multiple FCS files per pooled sample acquisition. Pooled samples were acquired until a total of 6 × 106 cell events had been collected, or all FBS/DMSO samples were collected, whichever occurred first.

Each sample was downsampled by 1,500,000 weighted by the proportion values. The down-sampled counts produced were then converted to rpK values. Multiple distribution fits were examined for these data, including Poisson, Negative Binomial, and Normal distributions. Quantile-quantile plots for each distribution demonstrated that the Normal distribution had the best fit across all peptides, as the median linear correlation coefficient across all peptides was the highest for this distribution. These null distributions were used to calculate p values for the observed log10(rpK) of each peptide within a given sample. For peptides with less than 10 unique values across all 71 controls, the background model was substituted with a peptide whose counts closely match the median.

Each IMPACC sample has a unique global sample identifier (sample_id) associated with the subject and biosample extraction time in the study. Assay feature values may be continuous real numbers, categorical variables, or character strings of nucleotides, depending on the assay type. Assay core-specific processing features may include technical quality control metrics of the sample assay.

Second, depending on the assay type, the sample-wise distributions of Counts values are qualitatively investigated for technical anomalies. For the genetics association testing, the sex/kinship of a participant derived from their sample Counts variables are compared with their clinical records.

Details of the other assay-specific parameters are provided below. Note that escalation samples were included in the WGCNA module creation, while only samples from scheduled visits were part of the visit 1 and longitudinal modeling.10"
37327781,96,STAR★Methods || Quantification and statistical analysis || Visit 1 and Longitudinal Model Analysis,"We performed a mixed effect analysis using module levels from baseline visit samples and investigated (1) if there is an ordinal trend from trajectory group 1 to trajectory group 5 and (2) if any pair of groups exhibit significant differences. This analysis included enrollment sites as a random effect, and age group, and sex as fixed effects, and tested for the ordinal trend with the R package clmm and pairwise difference with the R package lmer. We identified significant WGCNA modules whose adjusted p values are below 0.05. Significant modules can potentially be used for separating clinical groups at hospital admission."
37327781,97,STAR★Methods || Quantification and statistical analysis || Visit 1 and Longitudinal Model Analysis,"We next moved to longitudinal analysis for scheduled visits (visits 1–6) to identify WGCNA modules whose trajectories differ for different clinical groups. We performed a mixed generalized additive modeling analysis and modeled the module levels as a smooth function of admission time using the R package gamm4. For each pair of groups, we tested if the two groups have different longitudinal trends for the WGCNA modules after including the participant ID and enrollment site as random effects along with sex and age group as fixed effects. We claimed significance when the adjusted p value is below 0.05, and significant modules could indicate interesting molecular dynamics across clinical groups. Physician-reported sex at birth was used in all analyses except genetic association testing."
37327781,98,STAR★Methods || Quantification and statistical analysis || Identification of overlap between assays’ annotations,"For each assay, geneset set analysis was used to identify pathways overrepresented among feature (WGCNA modules or individual features) associated with the trajectory groups. To identify pathways enriched in two assays or more, the name/label of the pathways were matched across assays based on the similarity of the name using fuzzy matching (match allowing for mismatches characters) as implemented in the function stringdist_join of the R package fuzzyjoin (with default parameters). Incorrect matches were filtered out manually."

36764726,0,Title,Influence of the COVID-19 pandemic and social media on the behaviour of pregnant and lactating women towards vaccination: a scoping review
36764726,1,Abstract || Background,"Pregnant women, foetuses and infants are at risk of infectious disease-related complications. Maternal vaccination is a strategy developed to better protect pregnant women and their offspring against infectious disease-related morbidity and mortality. Vaccines against influenza, pertussis and recently also COVID-19 are widely recommended for pregnant women. Yet, there is still a significant amount of hesitation towards maternal vaccination policies. Furthermore, contradictory messages circulating social media impact vaccine confidence."
36764726,2,Abstract || Objectives,"This scoping review aims to reveal how COVID-19 and COVID-19 vaccination impacted vaccine confidence in pregnant and lactating women. Additionally, this review studied the role social media plays in creating opinions towards vaccination in these target groups."
36764726,3,Abstract || Eligibility criteria,"Articles published between 23 November 2018 and 18 July 2022 that are linked to the objectives of this review were included. Reviews, articles not focusing on the target group, abstracts, articles describing outcomes of COVID-19 infection/COVID-19 vaccination were excluded."
36764726,4,Abstract || Sources of evidence,"The PubMed database was searched to select articles. Search terms used were linked to pregnancy, lactation, vaccination, vaccine hesitancy, COVID-19 and social media."
36764726,5,Abstract || Charting methods,Included articles were abstracted and synthesised by one reviewer. Verification was done by a second reviewer. Disagreements were addressed through discussion between reviewers and other researchers.
36764726,6,Abstract || Results,Pregnant and lactating women are generally less likely to accept a COVID-19 vaccine compared with non-pregnant and non-nursing women. The main reason to refuse maternal vaccination is safety concerns. A positive link was detected between COVID-19 vaccine willingness and acceptance of other vaccines during pregnancy. The internet and social media are identified as important information sources for maternal vaccination.
36764726,7,Abstract || Discussion and conclusion,"Vaccine hesitancy in pregnant and lactating women remains an important issue, expressing the need for effective interventions to increase vaccine confidence and coverage. The role social media plays in vaccine uptake remains unclear."
36764726,8,Introduction,"Several infectious diseases are associated with adverse outcomes in pregnant women, foetuses and infants. Therefore, a strategy that has gained interest in recent years is vaccination during pregnancy as well as during lactation, as a means to reduce infectious disease-related morbidity and mortality in these target populations.1–3"
36764726,9,Introduction,"Pregnant women who contract influenza have an increased risk of influenza-related complications and hospitalisation compared with non-pregnant women.2 4 In addition, influenza infections during pregnancy are linked to an increased risk of preterm delivery and small-for-gestational-age infants. Infants younger than 6 months are at high risk of having severe influenza-related complications, often associated with hospitalisation and mortality.2"
36764726,10,Introduction,"Another infectious disease that forms a serious threat for neonates is pertussis, of which the disease burden and case fatality rate is highest in the first year of life.5 6"
36764726,11,Introduction,"A COVID-19 infection during pregnancy is linked to an increased risk of hospitalisation, admission to an intensive care unit and death in pregnant women.7 8 Several studies have also found that there is a higher risk of preterm delivery, stillbirth and pre-eclampsia.7 9 10 Furthermore, low birth weight, foetal distress and other respiratory symptoms are more frequent in neonates born to a mother who experienced a COVID-19 infection.7 10 Infants infected with COVID-19 in the postpartum period can become critically ill.11"
36764726,12,Introduction,"To better protect pregnant women, foetuses and infants against infectious disease-related complications, vaccination during pregnancy is an important strategy. Public health authorities worldwide have already implemented this approach for influenza and pertussis, while recently also adding vaccination against COVID-19.5 12–15"
36764726,13,Introduction,"Vaccination during pregnancy induces vaccine-specific antibodies that protect pregnant women against severe illness. Subsequently, these vaccine-induced antibodies are transferred from mother to baby across the placenta during pregnancy and via breastfeeding after birth.12 Therefore, if women did not receive a pertussis and/or influenza vaccine during pregnancy or are not yet fully vaccinated against COVID-19 with the advised vaccine doses, it is recommended to vaccinate in the postpartum period.16 17"
36764726,14,Introduction,"Despite the proven benefits of vaccination during pregnancy and lactation and the implementation of the vaccination strategy on a broad scale, there is still a significant amount of hesitation towards maternal vaccination policies. This is reflected by poor vaccine uptake in different regions and varying or lacking maternal vaccination programmes and recommendations in various countries.12 13 18 19 A previous systematic review,20 conducted before the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, defined factors that could possibly influence vaccination decision-making among pregnant women. The most important factor was found to be the recommendation from a healthcare provider (HCP) to vaccinate during pregnancy. However, other determinants such as previous vaccination behaviour and vaccine-specific factors could negate the recommendation from a HCP. This work also found that pregnant women used the internet or other media to search for information about vaccination, but these women did not perceive these channels to be the most trustworthy sources.20"
36764726,15,Introduction,"With the COVID-19 pandemic and the licensing of COVID-19 vaccines, debates around vaccination flared up again. Pregnant and lactating women were initially excluded from premarketing clinical trials for licensing of COVID-19 vaccines, which resulted in doubts about safety, immunogenicity and the efficacy of the vaccines in these target groups. However, based on evidence from other vaccines already administered to pregnant and lactating women, no safety or efficacy issues were expected. After weighing the benefits of vaccination against the complications of disease, different countries immediately started to approve COVID-19 vaccination for these groups. Different opinions, scientifically based or not, were shared via all sorts of social media, both by the general public and by HCPs. The aim of this scoping review is to give an update of the prepandemic systematic review mentioned above20 by trying to reveal how COVID-19 and its accompanying vaccination campaign impacted vaccine confidence in pregnant and lactating women. Also, this review intends to identify additional factors related to vaccine decision-making in lactating women. Furthermore, the role social media plays in creating opinions towards vaccination during pregnancy and/or lactation is studied."
36764726,16,Methods,"This scoping review was conducted following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines (online supplemental file 1). First, a research protocol was written and grey literature was searched (online supplemental file 2). Scientific literature was found by searching the PubMed database, without language restrictions. Keywords were identified based on the previous systematic review20 and additional search terms linked to social media and COVID-19 were added:"
36764726,17,Methods,"vaccin*, immuniz*, immunis*, antibodies, immune response, confidence, awareness, attitude*, anxiety, trust*, intent*, dilemma, perception*, misconception*, behaviour, behavior, anti-vaccin*, decision-making, vaccination refusal, fear*, distrust, mistrust, hesitancy, controvers*, belief*, criticis*, misinformation, intent*, choice*, concern*, knowledge, acceptance, willingness, uptake, barrier*, disinformation, complacency, fake news, pregnan*, maternal, prenatal, antenatal, parent*, lactating*, lactation, breast milk, breastfeeding, social media, internet, website*, communication*, social network*, social behavior, social behaviour, message*, forum, fora, blog*, discussion group*, online, Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, LinkedIn, Instagram, Reddit, YouTube, Messenger, WhatsApp, Telegram, COVID*, SARS-CoV-2, COVID*, corona*."
36764726,18,Methods,Publication dates were limited starting from 23 November 2018 since the prepandemic systematic review20 covered articles published to 22 November 2018. The search was done on 18 July 2022 (online supplemental file 3).
36764726,19,Methods,"Overall, 477 records were identified in the PubMed search. All records were screened by title and abstract, from which 46 were retained to screen by full text. Articles that did not mention pregnant and/or lactating women, the COVID-19 pandemic or vaccination and/or social media were excluded. Also, reviews and abstracts without full text were not included. If the article focused on outcomes of a COVID-19 infection or COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy/lactation, the article was rejected. Finally, after screening by full text, 37 records were selected to be included in this scoping review. Screening the references of the selected records—known as ‘the snowball search method’ or ‘snowballing’—yielded two additional articles."
36764726,20,Methods || Patient and public involvement,Patients/the public were not involved in the design or conduct of the study.
36764726,21,Results || COVID-19 vaccine acceptance in pregnant and lactating women and women planning to be pregnant,"In total, 32 articles about willingness to get vaccinated against COVID-19 during pregnancy, lactation and when planning to get pregnant were identified and included in this review. A summary of the selected articles can be found in table 1."
36764726,22,Results || COVID-19 vaccine acceptance in pregnant and lactating women and women planning to be pregnant || COVID-19 vaccine confidence in pregnant women and women planning to be pregnant,"Several studies were conducted on vaccine willingness in pregnant women before the availability of COVID-19 vaccines (N=12). In four of these studies, pregnant women were less likely to accept a future COVID-19 vaccine (29.7%–62.1%) compared with breastfeeding women (38.6%–69.0%) and non-pregnant women (73.4%–81.2%).21–24 In contrast, one study found that more pregnant women (65.9%) were willing to get vaccinated against COVID-19 compared with non-pregnant women (59.6%), although the difference was not significant.25 In addition, a high COVID-19 vaccine acceptance rate in pregnant women in China was detected (77.4%).26 Furthermore, willingness to get vaccinated during pregnancy varied greatly by country: COVID-19 vaccine readiness level was above 80.0% for pregnant women in India and Mexico and lower than 45.0% in Russia, Australia and the USA.22 In a study where six European countries were compared, the highest COVID-19 vaccine willingness during pregnancy was seen in Belgium (78.1%), whereas the lowest rate was found in Switzerland (29.7%).21"
36764726,23,Results || COVID-19 vaccine acceptance in pregnant and lactating women and women planning to be pregnant || COVID-19 vaccine confidence in pregnant women and women planning to be pregnant,"Twenty surveys were performed after licensure of COVID-19 vaccines, but some were conducted before the WHO and/or national authorities officially recommended vaccinating all pregnant women against COVID-19. A survey study conducted at the New York Presbyterian Hospital (USA) concluded that pregnant women—at that moment—were still less likely to accept a COVID-19 vaccine (44.3%) compared with breastfeeding (55.2%) and non-pregnant women (76.2%).27 Another survey study conducted in Saudi Arabia made the same significant conclusion for pregnant women and women planning to get pregnant compared with non-pregnant women and women not planning to get pregnant.28 A study performed in January 2021 in the USA divided the responders into two groups: that is (1) female HCPs preventing pregnancy and (2) female HCPs who are pregnant/lactating/attempting pregnancy. The research found a significant difference in vaccine willingness between both groups where group (1) significantly desired more to receive the vaccine compared with group (2).29Thirteen studies also mentioned COVID-19 vaccine coverage rates in pregnant women. Two studies measured the COVID-19 vaccine coverage in pregnant women during the same time period (March–April 2021) in two different countries: Germany30 and the USA.31 A remarkable difference in coverage between both studies was observed: 2.4% in Germany versus 21.7% in the USA.30 31"
36764726,24,Results || COVID-19 vaccine acceptance in pregnant and lactating women and women planning to be pregnant || COVID-19 vaccine confidence in lactating women,"Fifteen studies included lactating/postpartum women in their study population of which three studies found that lactating women were more likely to accept a COVID-19 vaccine (39.4%–69.0%) compared with pregnant women (13.8%–61.0%).21 27 30 Nevertheless, lactating women remain less willing to receive a COVID-19 vaccine than non-pregnant and non-nursing women.27 In an American follow-up study, 35.0% of postpartum women were willing to be vaccinated compared with only 14.0% of pregnant women. However, the breastfeeding status of the postpartum women was not clear.32 Another study from the USA found that women currently nursing or planning to breastfeed were less willing to receive a COVID-19 vaccine compared with women who were not.33 As for pregnant women, the acceptance rate widely varies among different countries with a 79.2% acceptance rate in Belgium compared with 38.6% in Switzerland.21"
36764726,25,Results || COVID-19 vaccine confidence in HCP,"The perception of French HCPs towards COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy was investigated via an anonymous survey distributed from January to March 2021. Overall, midwives were less likely to recommend COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy (37.5%), compared with general practitioners (50.7%) and obstetricians (58.8%).34"
36764726,26,Results || COVID-19 vaccine confidence in HCP,"To study how HCPs view COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy, a survey of women (including pregnant and lactating women), midwives, doctors providing maternity care and midwifery students was conducted in Australia in early 2021. The study found that doctors and midwifery students were significantly more likely to advise COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy compared with midwives. Unfortunately, in this study, pregnant and lactating women were not asked if a recommendation from a HCP was a motivational factor or not when looking at influential factors that determined pregnant and lactating women’s decision to be vaccinated.35"
36764726,27,Results || Determinants predicting COVID-19 vaccine acceptance,Most of the surveys (N=26) included in this review not only measured readiness to get vaccinated against COVID-19 during pregnancy or lactation but also described determinants linked with COVID-19 vaccine acceptance.
36764726,28,Results || Determinants predicting COVID-19 vaccine acceptance || Factors influencing COVID-19 vaccine acceptance during pregnancy,"The most important reason for refusing COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy is safety concerns, as described in 19 studies.22 24–27 30–32 36–46 These safety concerns include the assumption of potential harm to the baby and to the mother, both in the short and long term. Other concerns include that there is not yet enough clinical trial data on COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy22 24 27 30 32 42 and that COVID-19 vaccines are seen as not being trustworthy because they were developed and approved rapidly.22 24 31 38 In Japan, mistrust in the government was determined as the only significant factor linked to vaccine hesitancy among pregnant women.38 Not believing in vaccines and in the existence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, not being afraid of COVID-19, and trusting rumours on social media were also described as statistically independent risk factors for vaccine hesitancy among pregnant women.47"
36764726,29,Results || Determinants predicting COVID-19 vaccine acceptance || Factors influencing COVID-19 vaccine acceptance during pregnancy,"Receiving an influenza vaccine23 27 31 32 36 and/or pertussis vaccine during pregnancy24 32 are positive determinants for accepting COVID-19 vaccination among pregnant women. Other positive factors are a recommendation by a HCP or having a discussion with a HCP about COVID-19 vaccines,31 32 36 37 44 46 believing to be at high risk of or concerns about contracting COVID-19,22 29 32 being aware of having an increased risk of severe illness due to COVID-19,46 and living with individuals with or themselves suffering from comorbidities/high-risk conditions.31"
36764726,30,Results || Determinants predicting COVID-19 vaccine acceptance || Factors influencing COVID-19 vaccine acceptance during pregnancy,"Demographic factors associated with better COVID-19 vaccine willingness are a higher level of education,22 23 32 33 36 38–40 42 43 45 48 49 being employed,31 32 40 49 having a higher income,22 24 33 42 43 47 48 older age,22–25 32 33 36 39 42 45 being in the third trimester of gestation,23 26 37 45 48 multiparity36 45 and living in an urban area.43 47–49 Other demographic factors linked to COVID-19 vaccine willingness are race and ethnicity.24 29 31 39 41 49 Interestingly, pregnant Chinese women of younger age and with a lower level of education were more likely to accept COVID-19 vaccination.26"
36764726,31,Results || Determinants predicting COVID-19 vaccine acceptance || Factors influencing COVID-19 vaccine acceptance during lactation,"Lactating/postpartum women were found to have similar safety concerns to pregnant women.27 30 32 45 50 One of the reasons for refusing the vaccine or being hesitant about getting it is the lack of reliable data on the administration and effectiveness of a COVID-19 vaccine during lactation.30 50 Additionally, there were concerns in this target group that the COVID-19 vaccine could cause infertility.27"
36764726,32,Results || Determinants predicting COVID-19 vaccine acceptance || Factors influencing COVID-19 vaccine acceptance during lactation,"Two studies described several demographic factors in pregnant and lactating/postpartum women associated with a lower likelihood of vaccination: younger age,23 33 lower level of education23 33 and lower income.33 However, both studies did not distinguish between pregnant and lactating/postpartum women.23 33 Another study found that there was no significant difference in age and educational level in the group of lactating women willing to accept the vaccine and the group of lactating women resistant to the vaccine. However, lactating healthcare workers had a significantly higher COVID-19 vaccine acceptance level compared with non-healthcare workers.45"
36764726,33,Results || The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on other vaccinations,"Several studies also discussed vaccine willingness for other diseases in pregnancy during the COVID-19 pandemic. Two studies focused on influenza, one focused on pertussis while the other focused on vaccines during pregnancy in general.43 49 51 52 A study conducted in Turkey found that 77.0% of the interviewed pregnant women received or intended to receive vaccination during pregnancy. For 50.6% of these women, the COVID-19 pandemic had not affected their views on being vaccinated in the future.51"
36764726,34,Results || The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on other vaccinations,"Another study analysed the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on seasonal influenza vaccine compliance among pregnant and postpartum women in Israel from September 2020 to mid-January 2021. The research found that, despite the high incidence of COVID-19, vaccine uptake was similar to prepandemic times with 54.4% of the women studied being vaccinated against influenza.49"
36764726,35,Results || The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on other vaccinations,"The knowledge and attitudes of Polish pregnant women towards influenza vaccination was searched in 2021. In total, 21.0% had been vaccinated against influenza during pregnancy and 17.5% were planning to get vaccinated. The study stated that there is a link between influenza vaccine uptake and COVID-19 vaccine uptake in pregnant women. Women who refused COVID-19 vaccination did not intend to get an influenza vaccine and vice versa.43"
36764726,36,Results || The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on other vaccinations,"Furthermore, the experience of women getting vaccinated against pertussis during pregnancy in COVID-19 times was explored in the UK. The study used an online survey, which was spread from 3 August 2020 to 11 October 2020. The survey was completed by 922 pregnant women and 482 postpartum women who had been pregnant at some point after the first lockdown. The study found that 72.1% of pregnant women and 84.0% of postpartum women had received a pertussis vaccine during pregnancy even when access was hampered due to COVID-19 restrictions.52"
36764726,37,Results || The impact of social media on COVID-19 vaccine confidence,"Social media is an important source of information on COVID-19 vaccines for pregnant and lactating women. However, only 8.3% of the pregnant and lactating women in a Czech study reported that media/social media was an important factor when deciding to receive or not receive COVID-19 vaccination.45"
36764726,38,Results || The impact of social media on COVID-19 vaccine confidence,"Three surveys conducted in remote Alaskan communities between November 2020 and September 2021 focused on the impact of COVID-19 on the daily life and attitude towards COVID-19 vaccination of adults, including pregnant women, living in these communities. By September 2021, misunderstandings about vaccine recommendations during pregnancy and the effects of COVID-19 vaccination on fertility and DNA were present in participants where social media was identified as the primary source of information.53"
36764726,39,Results || The impact of social media on COVID-19 vaccine confidence,"The changes in Google Search interest on vaccination during pregnancy after the introduction of COVID-19 vaccination in Italy were investigated by using Google Trends. The data covered searches from 1 January 2019 to 31 October 2021. This made it possible to monitor the changes over two years from before the introduction of COVID-19 vaccination starting before the introduction of COVID-19 vaccination. The analysis of Google Trends indicated that the search interest for ‘vaccination in pregnancy’ was increased significantly (both qualitative and quantitative) compared with the predicted trend after the start of the Italian COVID-19 vaccination campaign. Moreover, further qualitative analysis showed that the increase was most likely due to concerns about COVID-19 vaccination.54"
36764726,40,Results || The impact of social media on COVID-19 vaccine confidence,"Among pregnant Romanian women, trusting rumours on social media had the greatest impact on vaccine hesitancy according to a study performed from 1 October 2021 to 1 December 2021. Compared with non-pregnant women (63.0%), significantly more pregnant women (78.1%) answered ‘yes’ to the question if they trusted social media rumours.47 In a survey conducted a few months later, Romanian unvaccinated pregnant women (44.7%) were significantly more likely to select social media as a trustworthy decision-making factor compared with vaccinated pregnant women (25.0%).48"
36764726,41,Results || The impact of social media on COVID-19 vaccine confidence,"A social media campaign called ‘One Vax Two Lives’ was set up in Washington to encourage the spread of scientifically based information about the risks of COVID-19 and benefits of COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy. The campaign reached a lot of people through ads on Facebook and Instagram, but the number of visitors to the informative website linked to the project remained rather low. It is not clear what the actual impact of the campaign was on vaccine confidence and uptake in pregnant women.55"
36764726,42,Discussion,"Maternal vaccination has already proven to be an effective means to prevent infectious disease-related morbidity and mortality in pregnant women, foetuses and infants. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the topic of vaccination during pregnancy and lactation received a lot of attention. In many countries, HCPs were one of the priority groups to receive vaccination against COVID-19. A lot of these HCPs were of fertile age, pregnant and/or lactating. These women were among the first fertile/pregnant/lactating women to be vaccinated against COVID-19. The vaccine was assumed to be safe for these target groups, based on previous research which generated reassuring evidence on the use of inactivated vaccines during pregnancy/lactation. However, lack of robust data on the safety, immunogenicity and efficacy of the COVID-19 vaccines and the existence of varying recommendations concerning COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy and lactation in different areas of the world started an important debate on COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy and lactation."
36764726,43,Discussion,"Even before the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, the WHO defined vaccine hesitancy as one of the top 10 threats to global health.56 Therefore, insights into factors influencing willingness to get vaccinated are crucial to plan effective interventions to increase vaccine coverage, especially in high-risk groups (such as pregnant and lactating women). Surveys performed during the COVID-19 pandemic—both before and after licensure of COVID-19 vaccines—demonstrated that willingness to get vaccinated against COVID-19 is generally lower in pregnant and lactating women than in non-pregnant and non-nursing women, which was not a surprising finding. On a global scale, vaccine hesitancy is more common in pregnant and lactating women. Many studies have reported that there are low coverage rates for influenza and Tdap vaccines in pregnant and lactating women. This population also shows low vaccine confidence. However, the overall reluctance towards COVID-19 vaccination is even higher compared with other vaccines recommended to be administered during pregnancy and/or lactation. This is possibly caused by the belief that COVID-19 vaccines were tested and approved too quickly and that in the initial premarketing trials no data were collected on pregnant and lactating women."
36764726,44,Discussion,"Safety concerns are reported as the main reason for refusal of COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy and lactation. The belief that COVID-19 vaccines could cause harm to the reproductive system, fetus/baby and/or to the women themselves is the most commonly cited driver for vaccine hesitancy. This is not a new observation; before the COVID-19 pandemic, similar concerns were mentioned as the most frequently cited barrier to being vaccinated during pregnancy.57"
36764726,45,Discussion,"The reasons for vaccine hesitancy towards COVID-19 vaccination in pregnant and lactating women are comparable to those in the general population, where concerns about safety, efficacy and the rapid development and approval of the vaccines are also the key determinants for COVID-19 vaccine refusal.58 These observations highlight the importance of high-quality clinical trials that include pregnant and lactating women. Furthermore, it is important to clearly and transparently communicate the findings from these trials to all population groups to increase vaccine coverage rates."
36764726,46,Discussion,"Before the start of the pandemic, a systematic review defined a HCP recommendation as the most important factor affecting vaccine confidence during pregnancy20; later studies found the same for COVID-19 vaccination. Recommendations from HCPs were pinpointed as the most influential strategy to increase vaccine willingness.44 However, these recommendations are often still overshadowed by anxiety about side effects and messages circulating social media. Another worrying factor is that not all HCPs support COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy. Especially, midwives seem to be less likely to recommend COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy, which is in line with studies on other vaccines before the pandemic.59 Therefore, it is crucial to provide HCPs access to tailored information on vaccination. Moreover, proper education of HCPs concerning the effects and importance of vaccines during pregnancy and lactation is needed."
36764726,47,Discussion,"Besides clear formulation of vaccination recommendations during pregnancy/lactation, it is of equal importance that correct information on these recommendations reaches the target groups. In a survey conducted in remote Alaskan communities, 22.8% of the participants were not aware that COVID-19 vaccination was recommended during pregnancy, 26.5% of the participants were unsure about a recommendation for pregnant women and 28.1% of the participants were uncertain if COVID-19 vaccination would affect fertility or not. Furthermore, participants often cited pregnancy and lactation as reasons to postpone COVID-19 vaccination.53 Additionally, in a questionnaire in Saudi Arabia on public knowledge regarding COVID-19 vaccination, 46.2% of males and 24.2% of females did not know if COVID-19 vaccination was recommended for pregnant women or not. Also, 72.4% of female participants stated that COVID-19 vaccination was not preferred during pregnancy.60"
36764726,48,Discussion,"To avoid the misconceptions mentioned above and to make sure that target groups are made aware of the most recent recommendations, specific programmes and tools need to be developed—each adapted according to region, language and accessibility. Here, proper education of HCPs is again key to support these programmes and tools to make these interventions effective."
36764726,49,Discussion,"Since social media has become an integral part of our lives, these platforms can be used to inform women who are pregnant, lactating or planning to be pregnant about vaccine recommendations. For many, it has become an important source of information and it is used to form an opinion about all kinds of topics, including COVID-19 and COVID-19 vaccination. In Italy, research showed that Google Search interest for ‘vaccination in pregnancy’ increased significantly after Italy’s COVID-19 vaccination campaign had started.54 Further research is still needed to accurately define the relation between social media and internet searches and actual vaccine uptake during pregnancy or lactation."
36764726,50,Discussion,"A 6-month follow-up study comparing COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy and actual vaccine uptake in pregnant and postpartum women concluded that being hesitant towards COVID-19 vaccines at baseline persisted, with only 10% of individuals transitioning from being vaccine hesitant to being vaccinated.32 This highlights that efficient interventions and educational strategies need to be developed to increase vaccine confidence, which subsequently increases vaccine coverage rates in pregnant and postpartum women. Therefore, a project was started at the University of Antwerp funded by the Vaccine Confidence Fund to identify which factors linked to social media influence vaccine confidence and in the long run the uptake of pertussis, influenza and COVID-19 vaccines in women of childbearing age, and pregnant and lactating women. The overall aim of this project—which this review is also part of—is to identify which interventions are efficient in increasing vaccine confidence in pregnant and lactating women."
36764726,51,Conclusion,"Vaccine hesitancy during pregnancy and lactation remains an important topic to study, especially in times of a pandemic and with the fast development of new vaccines. To improve vaccine confidence in these target groups, the inclusion of pregnant and lactating women in clinical trials could reduce safety concerns, as this was identified as the main reason to refuse vaccination. In addition, proper education of HCPs and clear, universal recommendations can also contribute to increase vaccine willingness. Further research is necessary to define the role social media plays in actual vaccine uptake. However, from our findings, it can be concluded that social media messages can influence vaccine confidence in pregnant and lactating women."
37783679,0,Title,NAD+ metabolism is a key modulator of bacterial respiratory epithelial infections
37783679,1,Abstract,"Lower respiratory tract infections caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae (Spn) are a leading cause of death globally. Here we investigate the bronchial epithelial cellular response to Spn infection on a transcriptomic, proteomic and metabolic level. We found the NAD+ salvage pathway to be dysregulated upon infection in a cell line model, primary human lung tissue and in vivo in rodents, leading to a reduced production of NAD+. Knockdown of NAD+ salvage enzymes (NAMPT, NMNAT1) increased bacterial replication. NAD+ treatment of Spn inhibited its growth while growth of other respiratory pathogens improved. Boosting NAD+ production increased NAD+ levels in immortalized and primary cells and decreased bacterial replication upon infection. NAD+ treatment of Spn dysregulated the bacterial metabolism and reduced intrabacterial ATP. Enhancing the bacterial ATP metabolism abolished the antibacterial effect of NAD+. Thus, we identified the NAD+ salvage pathway as an antibacterial pathway in Spn infections, predicting an antibacterial mechanism of NAD+."
37783679,2,Introduction,"Lower respiratory infections are the fourth leading cause of death globally, with Streptococcus pneumoniae (Spn) being the most common respiratory bacterial pathogen1. Thus, an in-depth understanding of infection processes on the molecular level is vital to enabling the development of new therapeutic options to face rising antibiotic resistance. Accordingly, host-pathogen interactions during pneumococcal infections are a field of intensive study. However, while most studies have focused on host responses towards Spn in dedicated immune cells2, the respiratory epithelium constitutes the first line of defence against lower respiratory tract infections. It forms a mechanical barrier, produces a thick, glycan-composed mucus to entrap bacteria and secretes various cytokines and chemokines to recruit immune cells to sites of infection. It also promotes direct bacterial killing by secreting antibacterial peptides3. Analyzing the immediate transcriptomic response of infected alveolar epithelial cells up to 4 h post Spn infection, Aprianto et al. have demonstrated an extensive dysregulation of gene expression, especially repression of genes involved in the immune response4. Yet, the effects of prolonged Spn infection on epithelial cell gene expression and metabolism have not yet been investigated."
37783679,3,Introduction,"Here, we employed a multi-omics approach to gain insights into the epithelial response against Spn, strain D39, infection. This approach revealed a dysregulation of key enzymes and metabolites of the Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) metabolism. By transitioning between its oxidized (NAD+) and reduced (NADH) forms, NAD acts as key electron transporter in cellular energy pathways. In addition, it is an important cofactor for a wide array of enzymes that convert NAD+ to the energy-depleted metabolite nicotinamide (NAM) (e.g., PARP, sirtuins5–7). De novo biosynthesis of NAD+ starts from diet-derived tryptophan or nicotinic acid8. However, the majority of cellular NAD+ is recovered from NAM via the NAD+ salvage pathway9. In the first salvage step, nicotinamide phosphoribosyl transferase (NAMPT) catalyzes the production of nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) from NAM10. Second, nicotinamide-mononucleotide adenylyl transferases (NMNAT) use NMN as a substrate to restore NAD+
9,11. The exact contribution of each metabolic pathway to the upkeep of NAD+ homeostasis differs depending on the tissue, environmental conditions and availability of nicotinamide precursors and other nutrients6,12."
37783679,4,Introduction,"To explore the functional relevance of the altered NAD+ metabolism described here, we manipulated different enzymes or metabolites and explored their effects on Spn infection. Thereby, we identified the modulation of the NAD+ metabolism as a previously unknown element in antibacterial defence against Spn. Direct treatment of Spn with NAD+ inhibited bacterial growth in a concentration-dependent manner, while other bacterial pathogens remained unaffected. Our study deepens the understanding of the interaction between Spn and the host metabolism and identifies the NAD+ metabolism as a potential therapeutic target against lower respiratory tract infection."
37783679,5,Results || Pneumococcal infection dysregulates the epithelial NAD+ metabolism,"To investigate host-pathogen interactions during Spn D39 infection of epithelial cells, we established an in vitro infection system using the bronchial epithelial cell line BEAS-2B. To assess the proteomic response of epithelial cells to Spn D39 by SILAC proteomics, BEAS-2B cells were infected with MOI 0.5 for 16 h or left uninfected. (Fig. 1A). The 5 most significantly upregulated proteins included two enzymes involved in the NAD+ metabolism, Nicotinamide phosphoribosyl transferase (NAMPT; fold change (FC) = 2.6, p = 0.000002) and Nicotinamide N-Methyl transferase (NNMT; FC = 1.7, p = 0.000148). Significant regulation of the NAD+ metabolism was further confirmed by mRNA microarray data (Fig. 1B). NAMPT and NNMT mRNA were upregulated compared to untreated controls after both Spn D39 infection and stimulation with the bacterial cell wall component lipoteichoic acid (LTA) for 9 or 16 h. In addition, mRNA of nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyl transferase 1 (NMNAT1) was significantly downregulated in BEAS-2B cells exclusively during later-stage infection (16 h). Metabolite measurements by LC-MS/MS revealed that NAD+, as well as multiple NAD+ precursors, were decreased after 16 h of Spn D39 infection (Fig. 1C). In summary, we found a clear dysregulation of NAD+ biosynthesis via the Preiss-Handler and NAD+ salvage pathways on a multi-omics scale (Fig. 1D, Supplementary Fig. 1).Fig. 1NAD+ biosynthesis is dysregulated during Spn D39 infection.A Volcano plot of protein expression upon Spn D39 infection.

Primary human bronchial epithelial cells (hBECs) from healthy donors were differentiated into a pseudostratified lung epithelium at an air-liquid interface. Cells were apically infected with Spn D39, MOI 20 for 16 h and gene expression was analyzed by qPCR (Fig. 2A). In infected hBECs, we found expression of NAMPT to be upregulated and NMNAT1 to be downregulated compared to uninfected controls (Fig. 2B, C). In the next step, human lung explants were injected with Spn D39 for 12 h and gene expression was determined (Fig. 2D). We found an upregulation of NAMPT and downregulation of NMNAT1, confirming our previous results (Fig. 2E, F). Re-analysis of publicly available gene expression datasets of Spn D39 infected mouse lungs equally revealed NAMPT upregulation and NMNAT1 downregulation in vivo. (Fig. 2G, H). In summary, we found the NAD+ salvage gene expression to be dysregulated upon Spn D39 infection in primary cell culture and in vivo.Fig. 2Regulation of NAD+ salvage associated genes ex and in vivo.A–C Primary human bronchial epithelial cells from healthy donors were differentiated into pseudostratified respiratory epithelium as air-liquid interface cultures.

37783679,7,Results || NAD+ production shows direct antibacterial effects,"To assess the role of NAD+ biosynthesis during the infection process, we performed siRNA knockdowns of NAMPT and NMNAT1 48 h prior to infection with Spn D39 (MOI 1, 16 h). Successful knockdowns were confirmed on transcript and protein levels (Supplementary Fig. 2). After both knockdowns, the intracellular NAD concentration was significantly decreased, whereas bacterial CFU after 16 h of infection was increased by approximately 40% compared to the scramble control (Fig. 3A, B). Based on these findings, we further addressed whether the antibacterial activity of NAMPT and NMNAT1 is mediated by NAD+ production. The addition of NAD+ to the Spn D39 infection of BEAS-2B cells (Fig. 3C; MOI 1, 16 h) or to host cell-free cultures of Spn D39 (Fig. 3D–F) revealed a concentration-dependent reduction of bacterial replication, suggesting a direct antibacterial effect of NAD+.Fig. 3Effects of Nicotinamide metabolites on pneumococcal replication.A BEAS-2B lung epithelial cells were transfected with indicated siRNA for 48 h prior to infection with Spn D39, MOI 1 for 16 h.

37783679,8,Results || NAD+ production shows direct antibacterial effects,"To further assess the role of NAD+ in the infection process, we aimed to increase the host cell NAD+ production during infection. First, we boosted NAD+ production by treatment with the precursor Nicotinamide riboside (NR), which was previously shown to increase intracellular NAD+ in vitro and in vivo13–15. NR treatment of BEAS-2B increased the intracellular amount of NAD (NAD+ and NADH) by a factor 2.3, compared to untreated controls (Fig. 4A). In the presence of host cells, NR treatment reduced bacterial replication by factor 0.3 compared to untreated controls (Fig. 4B). The effect could not be detected in the absence of host cells, as NR treatment of Spn D39 cultivated in host cell-free medium only caused a minor reduction of bacterial replication by a factor 0.9 (Fig. 4B). Knockdown of NMNAT1 prior to infection and NR treatment reduced NAD production (Fig. 4C) and partially rescued bacterial replication (Fig. 4D). We further confirmed these results using the NAD+ precursor NMN and NAM. In the absence of host cells, both precursors did not affect bacterial replication. In the presence of host cells, NMN and NAM treatment during infection increased intracellular NAD and reduced bacterial replication (Supplementary Fig. 3A–F). Furthermore, chemical inhibition of NAMPT using FK-866 increased bacterial replication (Fig. 4E), while NAMPT activation using SBI-797812 decreased Spn D39 replication (Fig. 4F). Next, we validated the effects of NR addition on the course of pneumococcal infection in an air-liquid interface model with well-differentiated primary human bronchial epithelial cells (Fig. 4G–I). During Spn D39 infection, basolateral addition of NR caused an increase in intra- and extracellular NAD (Fig. 4G, H) and a reduction of bacterial replication (Fig. 4I). These results were confirmed when using NMN to increase NAD+ in primary human bronchial epithelial cells, cultivated at an air-liquid interface, prior to infection (Supplementary Fig. 3G–I). In summary, NAD+ precursors exhibited no or minor direct antibacterial activity. In contrast, knockdown and chemical modulation of the NAD+ biosynthesis enzymes NMNAT1 and NAMPT, as well as metabolite treatment of Spn D39, revealed an anti-pneumococcal effect of NAD+.Fig. 4NR-mediated growth inhibition is dependent on NAD+ production.A BEAS-2B were treated with NR for 9 h as indicated and intracellular NAD was measured. B

C BEAS-2B were transfected with siNMNAT1 or a scramble control for 48 h. Afterwards, cells were treated with NR for 9 h and the intracellular concentration of NAD was determined. D Cells were transfected as described. 48 h post-transfection, cells were infected with Spn D39, MOI 1 or left uninfected and were treated with NR (500 µM) or PBS.

37783679,9,Results || The antibacterial effect of NAD+ is specific to Spn,"To determine whether interference with the host NAD+ metabolism is a general process affecting bacterial infections, we performed BEAS-2B infections with Streptococcus agalacticae (S.aga) and non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi) and determined the resulting expression of NAMPT and NMNAT1 (Supplementary Fig. 4). Both bacteria induced a significant upregulation of NAMPT expression 16 h post-infection (Supplementary Fig. 4A). S.aga infection induced a significant downregulation of NMNAT1 by approximately a factor of 0.75, while NTHi infection, by tendency, caused an upregulation of NMNAT1 (Supplementary Fig. 4B). Next, we investigated the effect of NAD+ treatment on S.aga, NTHi and an alternative, highly pathogenic strain of Spn (TIGR4). Treatment of Spn TIGR4 with NAD+ for 9 h caused a reduction in bacterial growth to approximately factor 0.4, confirming our previous results with Spn D39. In contrast, the replication of S.aga and NTHi was increased by approximately 50% (Supplementary Fig. 4D–F). In summary, these results reveal that, while the upregulation of NAMPT is a general pro-inflammatory process, the downregulation of NMNAT1 expression and antibacterial effects of NAD+ appear specific to certain bacteria."
37783679,10,Results || Transcriptional regulation of NMNAT1 is induced by Spn virulence factor pneumolysin,"We next focused on the specific mechanisms by which Spn mediates NAD+ salvage gene regulation in epithelial cells. Upregulation of NAMPT was previously shown to be induced via JAK-STAT signalling under pro-inflammatory conditions16. While we confirmed JAK-dependency of NAMPT upregulation in response to Spn D39 infection using the JAK inhibitor Ruxolitinib (Supplementary Fig. 5A), repression of NMNAT1 was not JAK-dependent (Supplementary Fig. 5B). Treatment of epithelial cells with heat-killed Spn D39 or LTA isolated from Spn D39 did not influence the expression of NMNAT1, suggesting that the repression is mediated by actively produced virulence factors of Spn D39 (Supplementary Fig. 5E–H). Therefore, we investigated the effects of three virulence factors that are actively produced and/or released during pneumococcal growth, the pneumococcal capsule, the oxidant H2O2 and the pore-forming toxin pneumolysin (ply) on NMNAT1 expression. Deletion of the capsule locus (Δcps) and the H2O2 producing pyruvate peroxidase (ΔspxB) did not influence NMNAT1 or NAMPT expression during infection (Supplementary Fig. 5C, D). Infection with a ply deficient mutant of Spn D39 induced NAMPT gene expression to a similar extent as wild-type Spn D39 (Fig. 5B). In contrast, a ply deletion resulted by tendency in a reduced expression of pro-inflammatory IL-8 (Fig. 5A) and in a significantly attenuated NMNAT1 repression compared to the wild type (Fig. 5C). Treatment of BEAS-2B with purified, lytical active pneumolysin at non-lytic concentrations caused a dose-dependent pro-inflammatory response as indicated by the upregulation of IL-8 and downregulation of both, NAMPT and NMNAT1 (Fig. 5D–F). Interestingly, treatment with a lytical inactive, non-pore-forming variant of pneumolysin did not cause a reduction of NAMPT and NMNAT1 expression (Fig. 5G–I). In summary, pneumolysin might mediate the reduction of NMNAT1 expression via pore formation.Fig. 5Transcriptional regulation of NMNAT1 is induced by pneumolysin (ply).A–C BEAS-2B cells were infected with Spn D39, WT or Δply for 16 h.

37783679,11,Results || Resistance against NAD+ is associated with a loss of capsule,"We next investigated the antibacterial mechanisms of NAD+. First, we confirmed that extrinsic addition of NAD+ to Spn D39 cultures results in increased total intrabacterial NAD (Fig. 6A). Then, resistant clones were generated by cultivating Spn D39 in liquid medium with increasing concentrations (50 µM to 5 mM) of NAD+. After six passages, bacteria were plated on blood agar supplemented with 500 µM NAD+ and three clones were picked. All three clones were almost completely resistant against antibacterial effects of NAD+ (Fig. 6B). Genome sequencing revealed the capsule biosynthesis-associated gene cps2E to be mutated in all resistant isolates, but not in the control strain (Fig. 6C). The mutation caused an early stop codon in two of three isolates (Clone 1, 3, Fig. 6D). Transmission electron microscopy revealed a complete absence of a capsule for the nonsense-mutated clones 1 and 3.Fig. 6Development of NAD+ resistance is associated with loss of capsule.A

37783679,12,Results || NAD+ acts antibacterial by interfering with the pneumococcal energy metabolism,"To assess if capsule synthesis and NAD+ sensitivity are causally linked, we performed NAD+ treatment of a capsule-deficient mutant of Spn D39. Treatment of Spn D39Δcps with NAD+ for 9 h did not show any growth-limiting effects (Fig. 7A). Biosynthesis of the pneumococcal capsule is an energetically costly process and closely linked to bacterial energy metabolism17. Under energetically detrimental conditions, the capsule was shown to interfere with pneumococcal growth18. We therefore hypothesized that NAD+ interference with intrabacterial ATP homeostasis is responsible for the growth-limiting effect of NAD+. Spn D39 WT, Δcps, and NAD+-resistant clone 3 all showed a significant reduction in intrabacterial ATP after NAD+ treatment (Fig. 7B). When left untreated, Spn D39 clone 3 and Spn D39Δcps showed an increase in intrabacterial ATP by a factor of 2 compared to the WT strain (Fig. 7B). Treatment of bacteria with 5 mM of the ATP precursor pyruvate in addition to NAD+ treatment abolished the NAD+-dependent reduction in intrabacterial ATP and reduction in bacterial CFU (Fig. 7C, D). In summary, the NAD+-mediated antibacterial effects were dependent on shifts in bacterial energy metabolism and capsule biosynthesis.Fig. 7Development of NAD+ resistance is associated with metabolic adaptation.A

37783679,13,Discussion,"In this study, we describe a previously unreported interference of Streptococcus pneumoniae with the host NAD metabolism. Our multi-omics approach revealed that in response to Spn D39 infection, NAMPT and NNMT are upregulated in bronchial epithelial BEAS-2B cells as part of a general, pro-inflammatory response. This is counteracted by a Spn-specific mechanism to downregulate NMNAT1 expression. The observed gene regulations seem to be pathophysiological relevant, as primary human bronchial epithelial cells cultivated at air-liquid interface, human lung explants and lungs of Spn-infected mice showed similar gene regulations. Since NMNAT1 catalyzes the final step of the salvage pathway and NNMT transforms NAM into the non-salvageable metabolite MNA, the identified gene regulations result in a reduced intracellular concentration of NAD+."
37783679,14,Discussion,"Here we report a Spn-mediated interference with the host NAD+ homeostasis. NAD+ was, however, shown to be a major player during other infections. During the viral infection process, NAMPT is routinely upregulated in a JAK-STAT-dependent manner. This results in an increased NAD+ biosynthesis to fulfil the energetic demands of the antiviral enzymatic machinery19. To evade this defence mechanism, several viruses synthesize macrodomains which counteract the function of NAD+-consuming PARP by hydrolyzing ADP ribosylation sites of host proteins20,21. In contrast, the murine hepatitis virus, a model coronavirus, was shown to deplete the cellular NAD+ storage by upregulating PARP activity22. Direct interference of viruses with NAMPT expression was suggested to be mediated by the induction of miRNA expression, which prevents NAMPT translation23,24. During bacterial infections, several bacterial pathogens, among them Shigella flexneri and the lung pathogens NTHi and Mycobacterium tuberculosis, were shown to utilize host-produced NAD+ for their own energy metabolism25–27. In accordance, with this study, NTHi infection induced NAMPT expression which might cause an increase in NAD+ production. As NTHi does not contain LTA, this effect might be associated with the Outer Membrane Protein 2 (porin), which was previously shown to activate TLR228. Besides that, bacteria of the gut microbiota were shown to produce nicotinic acid as an NAD+ precursor to enhance host NAD+ production29."
37783679,15,Discussion,"In contrast to these previously described upregulations of host NAD+ production by different bacteria, we here describe a Spn specific downregulation of the NAD+ biosynthesis via repression of NMNAT1 gene expression mediated by pneumolysin. To assess how this affects the infection process, we experimentally decreased NAD+ biosynthesis by knockdown of NAMPT or NMNAT1 prior to bacterial infections. Knockdown of NAMPT or NMNAT1 both reduced epithelial NAD production and increased bacterial replication. NAMPT is a multifaceted enzyme with previously reported cytokine function during pro-inflammatory processes30. NMNAT1, in addition to its biosynthetic function, was reported to act as a chaperone31. To our knowledge, however, no involvement of NMNAT1 in infection processes has been reported before. To determine whether NAD+ biosynthesis or secondary effects of NAMPT and NMNAT1 are responsible for the observed effect, we treated Spn D39 with NAD+ in various concentrations. This resulted in a host-cell independent reduction of bacterial replication+. Interestingly, the precursors NAM, NMN and NR showed no or minor inhibition of bacterial replication. Together, these results demonstrate a direct antibacterial effect of NAD+. It was shown that treatment with the NAD+ precursor NR increases the intracellular concentration of NAD+ in vitro and in vivo13–15. Boosting cellular NAD+ production by NR and NAM treatment was shown to inhibit murine herpes virus replication in vitro22 and connected to the energetic demand of the antiviral cellular machinery. Accordingly, replenishing intracellular NAD+ was proposed as an immune-enhancing pharmacological invention in the treatment of viral infections32. To confirm that epithelial NMNAT1 can produce sufficient NAD+ to exert antibacterial activity, we supplemented host cells with NR during infection resulting in a significant increase of intracellular NAD. Similar results were obtained when boosting host cell NAD+ synthesis by treatment with the precursors NMN and NAM. The NR, NMN and NAM-mediated inhibition of bacterial growth was almost or completely abolished in the absence of host cells, suggesting an involvement of host cell NAD+ biosynthesis in the antibacterial effects of NR. Knockdown of NMNAT1 in BEAS-2B prior to infection and NR treatment suppressed the cells’ ability to utilize NR for NAD+ synthesis. Following NMNAT1 knockdown, intra-host cell concentration of NAD+ was reduced and bacterial replication was partially rescued, confirming the role of NMNAT1 in antibacterial NAD+ production. The remaining growth-inhibitory effects of NR might be due to the observed minor antibacterial effect of NR, remaining NMNAT1, or enzymatic activity of the related enzymes NMNAT2 and NMNAT333,34. Results were confirmed when treating BEAS-2B cells with NMN and NAM, both of which did not exhibit any antibacterial activity in the absence of host cells. Additionally, NMN treatment of primary human bronchial epithelial cells cultivated at an air-liquid interface equally increased intracellular NAD and reduced bacterial replication, supporting the relevance of the identified mechanism in physiological settings. Likewise, treatment of BEAS-2B cells with the NAMPT inhibitor FK-86635 and the NAMPT activator SBI-79781236 resulted in increased and decreased Spn D39 replication, respectively, without requiring an extrinsic NR boost. This demonstrates the intrinsic potential of the NAD+ salvage pathway to maintain antibacterial NAD+ concentrations."
37783679,16,Discussion,"While a previous study showed shifts in metabolic gene expression of Spn D39 upon NADH treatment, no growth-limiting effects were observed37. Besides that, the effect observed in this study is not limited to the Spn D39, as treatment of Spn TIGR4 with NAD+ equally inhibited bacterial growth. It is, however, not a general antibacterial mechanism, as S.aga and the host ATP-dependent NTHi38 showed improved growth upon NAD+ treatment. Spn D39 frequently appears as an asymptomatic colonizer of the upper airways. The bacteria-specific responses to dysregulated NAD+ production raises the interesting question of whether and how NAD+ is involved in the interaction between Spn, airway microbiota and the host. In summary, boosting the host-cell NAD+ metabolism specifically inhibits pneumococcal replication during the infection process."
37783679,17,Discussion,"Since NAMPT was previously reported to be regulated via the JAK-STAT pathway16,39, we hypothesized NMNAT1 to be regulated via a similar pathway. However, while in accordance with the literature inhibition of JAK signaling by Ruxolitinib40 reduced NAMPT expression after Spn D39 infection, expression of NMNAT1 was not affected. In the following, we assessed which pneumococcal virulence factor is responsible for the observed gene regulation. Virtually all pathogenic strains of Spn express the pore-forming cholesterol-dependent cytolysin pneumolysin41,42. Besides its cytolytic effect, pneumolysin was shown to induce TLR4-dependent and -independent pro-inflammatory responses and cause DNA damage in the host cell43–45. Deletion of pneumolysin from Spn D39 rescued NMNAT1 expression in BEAS-2B after infection, while NAMPT expression remained unaffected. Furthermore, treatment of BEAS-2B with purified pneumolysin in sublytic concentrations caused a dose-dependent downregulation of NMNAT1 and NAMPT. The effects were dependent on lytic activity, as a lytical inactive variant of pneumolysin did not affect NMNAT1 and NAMPT expression. Interestingly, S.aga, which produces another pore-forming toxin, caused the downregulation of NMNAT1 similar to Spn46. These results support the hypothesis of dysregulation of host NMNAT1 expression as a pneumococcal mechanism to inhibit detrimental NAD+ production in the host. In contrast, the observed downregulation of NAMPT during treatment with purified pneumolysin might be masked by the pro-inflammatory JAK-STAT-dependent upregulation of NAMPT. Intracellular bacteria like Mycobacterium tuberculosis were previously reported to export toxins into the cytoplasm which deplete host-cell NAD+ and interfere with the host metabolism47,48. Related bacteria like Group A Streptococcus were shown to express NAD+ glycohydrolases which deplete intra-host-cell NAD+ and might thereby defend themselves against NAD+ mediated bacterial killing49. For a pore-forming cytolysin, to our knowledge, interference with the host cell energy metabolism has not been reported before."
37783679,18,Discussion,"To gain insight into the antibacterial mechanism of NAD+, we generated three NAD+ resistant strains of Spn D39 and compared their genome sequence to the wild type. All sequenced isolates showed mutations in the gene encoding for the protein CPS2E. CPS2E catalyzes an initial step in the attachment of the pneumococcal capsule to the membrane. Amino acid exchanges in this protein were previously shown to render Spn D39 unencapsulated50. The lack of capsule for two of the generated strains, both containing an early stop codon, was confirmed by electron microscopy. In line with this observation, a Spn D39 strain with deleted cps locus was resistant against NAD+ treatment in our experimental setting. The pneumococcal polysaccharide capsule surrounds the whole bacterial cell and is a major virulence factor, protecting Spn against adverse environmental conditions and the immune defense51. Capsule production, however, is a major biosynthetic effort and closely intertwined with the bacterial energy metabolism17,52. Starvation of Spn leads to a reduction in capsule size53 and under Cadmium-induced metabolic stress Spn was shown to reduce capsule production53,54. We therefore hypothesized that abolishing capsule production is an adaptation to a dysregulated energy metabolism. To test our hypothesis, we measured intrabacterial ATP with and without NAD+ treatment. NAD+ treatment of Spn D39 WT resulted in a reduction of intrabacterial ATP. Strikingly, an NAD+ resistant strain and Spn D39Δcps showed an approximately two-fold increased amount of basal intrabacterial ATP, supporting the link between NAD+ resistance and ATP homeostasis. We then aimed to abolish the dysregulation of ATP production by treating bacteria with the ATP precursor pyruvate in parallel to NAD+ treatment. Indeed, pyruvate treatment increased intrabacterial ATP and abolished the antibacterial effects of NAD+. It is important to note that NAD+ cannot freely diffuse through membranes. Bacteria like H. influenzae were previously shown to degrade NAD+ and take up the degradation products. In this study, however, the NAD+ precursor NR, NAM and NMN did not exhibit major antibacterial activity, suggesting a direct antibacterial mechanism of NAD+. Different nucleotide uptake mechanisms were reported in bacteria and yeast. Nucleotide exchange transporters were described to be involved in NAD+ uptake in chlamydia55 and yeast56. In peroxisomes, an NAD/AMP exchange transporter was reported to import NAD+ across membranes57 and a similar process might be involved in NAD+ uptake and metabolic dysregulation in Spn. Furthermore, Spn is well known for its natural competence, its ability to take up DNA fragments via membrane channels and ATP-dependent translocases. This process might be involved in the uptake of NAD+ and reduction of intrabacterial ATP levels58,59. Alternatively, NAD+ interference with the bacterial ATP homeostasis might be associated with the recognition of NAD+ by bacterial surface receptors or interference with ATP-consuming processes on the bacterial cell surface60. Interestingly, in contrast to other NAD+ precursors, NR caused a mild reduction of bacterial replication in the absence of cells. NR can likely be imported into Spn by PnuC61. While the growth-limiting effect of NR was minor compared to direct NAD+ treatment of bacteria or the growth limitation in the presence of cells, uptake of NR as a degradation product of NAD+ might further be involved in NAD+ mediated growth-limiting effects against Spn. Collectively, these data highlight the link between NAD+ stress, capsule biosynthesis, and bacterial metabolic dysregulation, and provide a mechanism for the antibacterial activity of NAD+."
37783679,19,Discussion,"There are limitations to our study. It is difficult to determine how the NAD+ concentrations used in this study relate to the actual extracellular concentration of NAD+ in vivo. In human blood, NAD+ concentrations were determined to be approximately 33 µM62. While this is below the threshold for significant growth inhibition of Spn in our study, concentrations might be higher in the infection-relevant microenvironments like the lung alveoli, especially upon infection-induced host cell lysis63."
37783679,20,Discussion,"Furthermore, extensive animal experiments to confirm increased NAD+ concentrations after precursor supplementation and its effect on bacterial replication were beyond the scope of this study. Nevertheless, we were able to confirm the NAD+ salvage dysregulation in infected mouse lungs and showed the antibacterial effects of NAD+ production in ex vivo human lung infection models. Since an increase of NAD+ levels following precursor treatment in vivo is well established12,64, it seems likely that the antibacterial effect of increased NAD+ production by nicotinamide precursor supplementation will hold up in vivo."
37783679,21,Discussion,"While, this study investigated the effect of differentially regulated host NAD+ biosynthesis on the infecting bacteria, changes in metabolite homeostasis and repressed NAD+ production are likely to have important consequences on host cell function as well. Interestingly, in addition to NAMPT and NMNAT1, the expression of NNMT was upregulated in BEAS-2B. MNA, the product of the enzymatic reaction catalyzed by NNMT was previously shown to exhibit anti-inflammatory effects in mice and humans65,66. Elevated amounts of MNA were furthermore shown to increase THP-1 proliferation and are associated with negative outcomes in cancer patients. These results thereby further highlight the importance of the nicotinamide metabolism during pneumococcal infections."
37783679,22,Discussion,"Finally, NAD+ is an important energy source for antiviral host responses19 and is expected to be similarly important for mounting antibacterial responses. Reduced intracellular NAD+ and therefore reduced activity of NAD+-dependent sirtuins was associated with aging processes67. It was recently proposed that residential bacteria contribute to Alzheimer’s disease and progression68. Should the observed dysregulation of NAD+ production continue after bacterial clearance, this raises the fascinating question of whether pneumococcal infections, especially pneumonia and meningitis, cause long-term detrimental metabolic effects, contributing to accelerated lung or brain ageing. The same question holds for other viral and bacterial infections that interfere with the expression of genes involved in NAD+ biosynthesis."
37783679,23,Discussion,"Taken together, our study reveals NAD+ biosynthesis as a previously overlooked antibacterial defence mechanism against Streptococcus pneumoniae and sheds further light on the importance of the energy metabolism as a key playing field of host–pathogen interaction during infection."

Additional N were performed in case of small effect sizes or high variation between replicates. 6 N were performed for metabolome analysis, as the metabolites in question can be highly volatile71. Replicates were excluded if they did not match quality control criteria (RNA quality, IL-8 expression). When immortalized cell lines were used, experiments were reproduced with at least 3 different passages of cells. Observed gene regulations were further reproduced using two different batches BEAS-2B cells obtained by ATCC and Merck, respectively.

37783679,35,Methods || Purification of LTA,"LTA purification was done essentially following our published protocol77. Bacterial pellets were suspended in citrate buffer (50 mM, pH 4.7) and disrupted three times by French press (Constant Cell Disruption System, Serial No. 1020) at 10 °C at a pressure of 20 kPSI (Spn D39) or 40 kPSI (Sa), respectively. SDS was added to a final concentration of 4% to the combined supernatants. The solution was incubated for 30 min at 100 °C and was stirred at RT overnight. The solution was centrifuged at 30,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The pellet was washed four times with citrate buffer using the centrifugation conditions as above. The combined LTA-containing supernatants were lyophilized. The resulting solid was washed five times with ethanol (centrifugation: 20 min, 20 °C, 10,650 × g) to remove SDS and lyophilized. The resulting pellet was suspended in citrate buffer and extracted with an equal volume of butan-1-ol (Merck) at RT under vigorous stirring. The phases were separated by centrifugation at 2100 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The aqueous phase (containing LTA) was collected, and the extraction procedure was repeated twice with the organic phase plus interphase. The combined aqueous phases were lyophilized and subsequently dialyzed for 5 days at 4 °C against 50 mM ammonium acetate buffer (pH 4.7; 3.5 kDa cutoff membrane); the buffer was changed every 24 h. The resulting crude LTA was purified further by hydrophobic interaction chromatography (HIC) performed on a HiPrep Octyl-Sepharose column (GE Healthcare; 16 × 100 mm, bed volume 20 ml). The LTA-containing pellet was dissolved in the HIC starting buffer at a concentration of 15 mg ml−1 and purified by HIC using a linear gradient from 15 to 60% propan-1-ol (Roth) in 0.1 M ammonium acetate (pH 4.7). The LTA-containing fractions were combined, lyophilized, and washed with water upon freeze drying to remove residual buffer.

By using Proteome Discoverer™ 1.4 (Thermo Fisher Scientific), detected peptides were mapped to the Uniprot protein database limited to human entries. Per sample and identified protein, a light-to-heavy (i.e., sample-to-standard) ratio was calculated. These ratios were used to further calculate log2 fold-changes (infected vs control) and q-values by moderated t-test (data analysis described in81).
