## Training machine learning classifiers on PubMed Central data


In this project we will try to train machine learning models that are useful for characterizing and indexing medical literature. We will work on documents that are freely available from the PubMed Central repository at the US National Library of Medicine, but our goal is to develop models that can be broadly applied to biomedical text.
